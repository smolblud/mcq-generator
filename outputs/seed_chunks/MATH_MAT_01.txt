A matrix is a rectangular arrangement of numbers into rows and columns. An augmented matrix is a shorthand for a linear system: each row represents an equation and each column a variable or constants column.
Augmented matrices keep all system information without writing variable symbols. Example: system 1x+3y=5; 2x+5y=6 corresponds to augmented matrix [ [1 3 : 5], [2 5 : 6] ].
