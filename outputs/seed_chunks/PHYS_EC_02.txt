text:
Electric field E is defined as force per unit charge at a point: E = F/q_test. Fields allow forces to act at a distance. Most macroscopic objects are neutral, but friction or contact can give net charge. A neutral object can be attracted to a charged object via induced polarization of atoms.
notes: electric field definition, polarization, neutrality vs. charge
