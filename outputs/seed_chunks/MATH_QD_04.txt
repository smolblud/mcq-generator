Completing the square and quadratic formula. For ax^2 + bx + c = 0, rearrange and complete square: (x + b/(2a))^2 = (b^2 - 4ac)/(4a^2). Taking square roots and solving yields x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)]/(2a).
This derivation shows the quadratic formula and gives the solutions in terms of a, b, c.
notes: completing the square derivation leading to quadratic formula
