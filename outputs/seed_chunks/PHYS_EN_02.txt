text:
Work is energy transferred by a force acting through a displacement: W = F d cosθ. If force and displacement are parallel, cosθ=1 and W=Fd (positive work); opposite → negative work; perpendicular → zero work. Power is the rate of doing work: P = dW/dt or average P = W/Δt.
notes: work definition, sign via cosθ, power
