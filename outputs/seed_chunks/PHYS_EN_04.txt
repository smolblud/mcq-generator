Work with angled motion: when displacement is not parallel to a force, use W = F d cosθ to take the parallel component. For changing forces, compute work via an integral W = ∫ F·ds or use force–displacement graphs. Energy conservation: in an isolated system total energy is constant—mechanical energy converts between kinetic and potential forms when nonconservative forces are negligible.
notes: angled work, calculus for variable forces, conservation principle
