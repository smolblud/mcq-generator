Top tips for subject–verb agreement: 
1. Read the subject and verb together, ignoring extra words. 
2. Remove prepositional phrases to reveal the real subject. 
3. Beware of “proximity illusion,” where a nearby plural noun distracts from a singular subject. 
Practice by mentally substituting pronouns or simplified forms to check agreement.
