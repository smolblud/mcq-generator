Superposition: net electric force or field from multiple charges is the vector sum of contributions from each charge. Coulomb forces and fields are vectors; direction matters. Units: F in newtons (N), E in N/C; k ≈ 8.99×10^9 N·m^2/C^2.
notes: superposition principle, vector nature, units and k constant
