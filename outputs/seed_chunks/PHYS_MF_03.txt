text:
Forces in two dimensions are treated by components. Typical forces: gravity (vertical, F_g), normal force (vertical, F_n), applied force (may have horizontal and vertical parts), and friction (horizontal opposite motion). Solve independently per axis: ΣF_x = m a_x, ΣF_y = m a_y. Free-body diagrams and consistent sign convention are important when adding vector components.
notes: components, typical forces, free-body diagrams, axis separation
