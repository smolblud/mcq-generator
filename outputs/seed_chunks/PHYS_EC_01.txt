Coulomb's law: the electrostatic force between two point charges q1 and q2 separated by distance r is F_e = k q1 q2 / r^2 (inverse-square law). Like charges repel; opposite charges attract. The magnitude depends on the product of the charges and inversely on r^2.
notes: Coulomb's law, inverse-square, sign indicates attraction/repulsion
