The imaginary unit is the backbone of the complex number system: i = sqrt(-1) and i^2 = -1.
This shows i is a solution to x^2 = -1, which makes the previously unsolvable equation solvable by introducing i.
An imaginary number is any complex number of the form bi where b is a nonzero real number; examples: 3i, i*sqrt(5), -12i.
