text:
Energy is a scalar measured in joules (J). Kinetic energy for a translational object is K = 1/2 m v^2 (depends on speed, not direction). Potential energy depends on configuration (e.g., gravitational potential energy depends on height). Energy values depend on the observer's reference frame because speed depends on frame.
notes: definitions, K = 1/2 mv^2, scalar nature, frame dependence
