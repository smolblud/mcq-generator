Matrix multiplication: each entry c_{i,j} of product C=AB is the dot product of row i of A with column j of B. Example A=[[1 7],[2 4]], B=[[3 3],[5 2]] -> C where c_{1,2} = [1,7]·[3,2]=1*3+7*2=17.
Dimension rule: (m×n)·(n×k) is defined and results in (m×k). Identity matrix I_n acts like 1: A·I = I·A = A. Matrix multiplication is not commutative: AB ≠ BA in general.
notes: multiplication, dot product, dimension rule, identity, noncommutativity
