text:
A complex number has form a + b i where a and b are real. a is the real part and b the imaginary part.
Plotting: represent a+bi as the point (a,b) in the complex plane: the horizontal axis is the real axis, vertical is the imaginary axis. Example: 3 - 5i corresponds to (3,-5).
Operations: multiply a real number by a complex number by distributing; example -4(13+5i) = -52 - 20i.
notes: classification, complex plane, plotting, multiplying real*complex
