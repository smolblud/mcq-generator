Parameter dependence: F_e is directly proportional to q1 and q2: increasing either increases force (direct relation). F_e is inversely proportional to r^2: increasing distance decreases force (inverse relation). Use proportional reasoning to predict changes.
notes: direct vs inverse relations, how changing q or r affects F_e
