Weight near Earth's surface: for an object in free fall the acceleration magnitude is g ≈ 9.8 m/s^2. From a = F_g/m and a = g we obtain F_g = mg. Weight is a vector (downward) of magnitude mg. The weight may be balanced by a normal force (object at rest) or unbalanced (object accelerating).
notes: derivation F_g = mg, meaning of weight, sample uses
