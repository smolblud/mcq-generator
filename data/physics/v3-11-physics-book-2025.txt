PHYSICAL QUANTITIES AND MEASUREMENTS

Physics is based on experimental observations. Observations may be qualitative or quantitative.
Qualitative observations have no associated numbers. This deal with facts that can be observed
with our five senses: sight, smell, taste, touch and hearing. Colors, shapes and textures of
objects are examples of qualitative observations. Observations, like ‘water keeps its level’,
is also an example of qualitative observation. A quantitative observation includes numbers, and
is also called a measurement. We can measure mass, time, distance, speed, pressure, force,
torque, momentum, and energy. Quantitative observations are useful to a scientist.

1.1 ESTIMATION OF PHYSICAL QUANTITIES

In our daily life, we may face some situations like: What will be the height of this building? Will
the piece of equipment fit in the back of our car, or do we need to rent a truck? How long will
this download take? How large a current will be there in this circuit? How many houses could a
proposed power plant actually power if it is built? Usually, we solve such problems by making
estimations. In many circumstances, scientists and engineers also need to make estimates of
some specific physical quantity with the help of little or no actual data.

An estimation is a rough educated guess of the value of a physical quantity by using prio
experience and sound physical reasoning.

An estimation usually includes the identification of correct physical principles and a good guess
about the relevant variables. Estimation is very useful in developing a physical sense. Estimation
does not mean guessing a formula or a number at random. Some of the following strategies may
help to improve our skill of estimation:

Estimation of length: When estimating lengths, remember that anything can be a ruler. For
breaking a big thing into smaller things, first estimate the length of one of the smaller things
and then multiply this value to the number of smaller things to obtain the length of the big
thing. For example, to estimate the height of building, we first count the number of floors it
has. Then, estimate the height of a single floor by imagining how many people would have to
stand on each other's shoulders to reach the ceiling. In the last, we estimate the height of a
person. These estimates give you the height of the building.

Sometimes it also helps to do this in reverse, i.e., to estimate the length of a small thing which
in bulk making up a bigger thing. For example, to estimate the thickness of a sheet of paper,
estimate the thickness of a stack of paper and then divide it by the number of pages in the
stack. These same strategies of breaking big things into smaller things or aggregating smaller
things into a bigger thing can sometimes be used to estimate other physical quantities, such as
mass and time. In such situations, some of the length, mass and time scales, as shown in Table

1.1 may be helpful.
Estimate Areas and Volumes from Lengths: While dealing with area or volume of a complex

object, introduce a simple model of the object, such as a sphere or a box. Estimate the linear
dimensions (such as the radius of the sphere or the length, width, and height of the box) and

then use standard geometric formulas to find the area or volume. If you have an estimate of

area or volume, you can also do the reverse; that is, use standard geometric formulas to get an
estimate of its linear dimensions.

Table 1.1: The estimation of some physical quantities

Diameter of proton = 107" Mass of electron = 10°

Mass (kg)
Salant ae TCP <°| Maa Se AO Age of Earth = 10"7

Estimate Mass from Volume and Density: To estimate the mass of an object, it is helpful first
to estimate its volume, and then to determine its mass using an estimate of its average density
(recall, that density has dimension of mass/volume, so mass = density x volume). For this
estimation, it helps to remember that the density of air is about 1 kgm, the density of water
is 10° kg m”’, and the densest everyday solids has a maximum value around 10‘ kg m?. Asking
yourself whether an object floats or sinks in either air or water can give you a rough estimate
of its density. You can also do the reverse: if you have an estimate of an object’s mass and
its density, you can use them to get an estimate of its volume.

Example 1.1: Estimate the energy required for an adult man to walk up through stairs from
ground floor to 1st floor?

We have to take the following estimations:

1.2 DERIVED UNITS IN TERMS OF BASE UNITS

In Grade 9, we have studied about base and derived physical quantities and their units. We
know that derived units can be expressed in terms of base units and are obtained by multiplying
or dividing base units with each other. Here, we will express some more derived units as
prerhucts or isha of the SI base units. Let us first take force as an sesh

Now, we put SI sits for each shesicat ssiany i, N for ‘croft kg jee mass, m for theiaconart
and s for time, so we get:

Now, we put SI units for each physical quantity i.e., J for work, kg for mass, m for displacement
and s for time, so we get: a

Similarly, we can express other derived units as products or quotients of the S! base units. Some
examples are shown in the Table 1.2.

Dimension denotes the qualitative nature of a physical quantity. For example, length, width,
height, distance, displacement, radius etc. all are measured in meters because they have the
same nature and thus share the same dimensions.

Dimension of a physical quantity is often represented by capital letter enclosed in square
brackets [ ]. Dimensions for base quantities are given in the Table 1.3.

Table 1.3: Diménsions of Base Oljantitie:

intensity of light [J]

Dimensions of derived quantities are obtained by multiplication or division of the dimensions
of base quantities, from which these quantities are derived. For example, the dimension for
area, volume, velocity and acceleration are [L?], [L*], [LT “] and [LT?] respectively.

Thus, dimensions. give the relation of a given physical quantity with base quantities i.e. mass,
length, time etc. There are the following essential terms used in dimensional analysis:

--- PAGE 12 ---
PHYSICAL QUANTITIES AND MEASUREMENTS

Dimensional Variables: Those physical quantities that have dimensions and variable in
magnitude are called dimensional variables. Some dimensional variables are length, velocity,
acceleration, force, energy and acceleration etc.

Dimensional Constants: Those physical quantities that have dimensions and a constant
magnitude are called dimensional constants. Some examples of dimensional constants are
Planck’s constant (h), gravitational constant (G), speed of light in vacuum (c) and ideal gas
constant (R) etc.

Dimensionless Variables: Those physical quantities that have no dimensions and have variable
magnitudes are called dimensionless variables. Some examples of dimensionless variables are
plane angle, solid angle, strain and coefficient of friction etc.

Dimensionless Constants: Those physical quantities that have no dimensions and have constant
magnitude are called dimensionless constants. The pure numbers (1, 2, 3, ....), the exponential
constant (e = 2.718) and nm are some examples of dimensionless constants.

1.3.1Advantages of Dimensions

Using the method of dimensions (called dimensional analysis), we can check the homogeneity
of an equation, derive a possible formula and determine units of physical quantities.
Dimensional analysis makes use of the fact that dimensions can be treated as algebraic
quantities. That is, quantities can be added or subtracted only if they have the same
dimensions. Furthermore, the terms.on both sides of an equation must have the same
dimensions.

(i) The Homogeneity of an Equation
In order to check the correctness of an equation, we must ensure that both sides of the equation

have the same dimensions: otherwise, the equation cannot be considered as a physically correct
equation. This is called the principle of homogeneity of dimensions.

Let us check whether the equation v; = vi + at is saciaeseli .8
Dimensiorss of L.H.S. = [ LT*]

Dimensions of R.H.S. = [LT] +[LT7][T] | Gry
=[LT’]+ [LT] bf J
=2[(LT*] ot

As 2 is dimensionless constant, therefore
Dimensions of L.H.S = Dimensions of R.H.S
Hence, the equation is dimensionally correct. “5

(ii) To Derive a Possible Formula
Deriving a relation for a physical quantity depends on the correctly guessing various factors on

which the physical quantity depends. Let us derive the formula for wavelength of matter waves
using dimensional analysis.
As wavelength (A) of matter waves may depend Gpon Planck’s constant (h), velocity (v) and
mass (m) of the particle.
So, the relation for the wavelength (A) will be of the ies?

1) Dimensional analysis does not distinguish between the physical quantities having same
dimensions. For example, if the dimensional formula of a physical quantity is [ML?T~] it

may represent work, or energy, or torque.

2) Dimensional analysis cannot be used to derive formulas containing trigonometric

functions, exponential functions, logarithmic functions, etc.

3) Dimensional analysis cannot determine the dimensionless constant when deriving a

possible formula.

4) Dimensional analysis doesn’t always prove that a relation is physically correct although
relation is dimensionally correct. However, a dimensionally wrong equation is always

wrong.

Example 1.2: Derive the formula for the time period of a simple pendulum using

dimensional analysis,

Solution: The time period of a simple pendulum is possibly depending on the mass of the bob
(m), the length of the pendulum (l), the angle which the string makes with vertical (6) and the

acceleration due to gravity (g). So, the relation for the time period T will be of the form:

Ta m*l° 6° 94

T = (constant) m? Ll 6° ¢4
We have to find the values of powers i.e. a, b, c and d:
Using the dimension on both sides, we get:

[ M° L°T ] = constant [M]* [L]***[ T }-24
Equating the powers of M on both sides of equation (2), we get:

1.4 PRECISION AND ACCURACY

Science is based on observations and experiments, which involve measurements. Precision is
measurements of the same physical quantity agree with each other. Accuracy refers to how
closely a measurement agrees with a standard or true value. Hence:

For Your Information

(a) precise and (b) precise but {e) not precise (d) neither precise
mone a. but accurate

To understand the concept of precision and accuracy, consider a person who weighs exactly
160.0 pounds and he weights himself three times on three different scales. Results of the scales
are:

Scale A: 170.1, 169.9 and 170.0 pounds.

Scale B: 161, 162 and 158 pounds.

Scale C: 159.9. 160.0 and 160.1 pounds.

14

--- PAGE 15 ---
PHYSICAL QUANTITIES AND MEASUREMENTS Z

— >
Dy oe

In this case, the weight measured by scale A is very precise, but not accurate. The weight
measured by scale B is fairly accurate but not precise. The weight measured by scale C is both
precise and accurate.

The precision of a measurement is associated with least count of the measuring instrument.
The smaller the least count of the measuring instrument, the greater its precision. Precision is
indicated by the absolute uncertainty in measurement. Accuracy is indicated by the fractional
or percentage uncertainty or error in measurement. The smaller the magnitude of fractional or
percentage uncertainty or error, the greater its accuracy.

1.5 UNCERTAINTIES

In Grade 9, we have studied about the sources of human error, systematic error and random
error in experiments. The difference between the true value and observed value of a
measurement is called error. i.e.,

All measurements 3 have a degree of uncertainty. This is caused by two tacts, the limitations
of the measuring instrument (systematic error) and the skills of the experimenter.

Absolute uncertainty is equal to the least count of a measuring instrument, for example the
length of a glass slab measured with a meter rod is 37.5 cm. The least count of meter rod is 1
mm = 0.1 cm, then the absolute uncertainty in the measured value will be + 0.1 cm i.e., + 0.05
cm uncertainty develops at each end. For example, if one end of the slab coincides with 20.5
cm mark and the other end with 58.0 cm mark of meter rule, the length of the slab along with
uncertainty is given by:

(58.0 + 0.05) cm — (20.5 + 0.05) cm = (37.5 + 0.1) cm
15

--- PAGE 16 ---
PHYSICAL QUANTITIES AND MEASUREMENTS

It means that the length of slab is between 37.4 cm and 37.6 cm.
In the above measurement, precision is + 0.1 cm, which is equal to the magnitude of absolute

nty.

The accuracy in the measurement is indicated by the jyaape (2.0 + 0.1),mm, then
magnitude of fractional error. Here: Actual/Absolute

Percentage uncertainty = fractional uncertainty x 100 %
The smaller the magnitude of fractional (relative) uncertainty or error, the greater will be the
accuracy of measurement.

1.5.1 Rules for Calculating Uncertainties in Final Result

There are some rules for calculating uncertainties in different cases but we need to be very
careful whether we use the absolute or percentage uncertainty in each case.

Let x and y are two different physical quantities with uncertainties Ax and Ay respectively. If z
is a physical quantity which is obtained by operating x and y, then the propagated uncertainty
Az in the result can be calculated by using the following rules.

a) Rule for Addition and Subtraction
If two or more than two measured quantities are added or subtracted, then their absolute

uncertainties are added to get uncertainty in the result.

If: Z=x+y or z=x-y LA.

then; _—Az= + (Ax + Ay) Rit ia
For example, if: X + Ax = (24.0 + 0.1) cm

and y + Ay = (30.0 + 0.1) cm

then; Az=+0.2cm

b) Rule for Multiplication and Division .
If two or more than two quantities. are multiplied or divided, then their percentage

uncertainties are added to get uncertainty in the result. oe ,
If: Z=xy or z=x/y, oy 4
then; % uncertainty in z = % uncertainty in x + % uncertainty in y

c) Rule for Power of a Quantity : ,
The total uncertainty in power of a quantity is equal to the percentage uncertainty multiplied

with that power.
If: Z= x:
then; — _ percentage uncertairities in z = + 3 (percentage uncertainty in x).

d) Uncertainties in Average Values of Many Measurements . .
The uncertainty in the average value is calculated by adopting the following steps:

i) Find the average of measured values.
ii) Find the deviation of each value from the average.

iii) The mean deviation is the uncertainty in the average.
For example, three readings are recorded for the radius of a small cylinder as:

f, = 1.50 cm, f= 1.51.cm and f= 1.52 cm
The uncertainty in the average radius is calculated as:

Finding average: PG ak Fa
1.50 cm +1.510m+1.52 cm
iz Tims Seehies = 1.51cm
Finding deviation: Al, =r - f, = 1.51- 1.50 =0.01 cm

Ar, =F - f, =1.51-1.51=0¢em
Af, =r - = 1.51 - 1.52 = 0.01 cm

Finding mean deviation: Ar = WINS
| _ 0.01¢m+0 cm+0.01 cm

3 = 0.0067 cm = 0.007 cm

e) Uncertainty in Timing Experiment
The time period T of a vibrating body can be found by dividing time of multiple vibrations by
the number of vibrations.

T= Time of multiple iviies

No. of vibra ob. ey
The uncertainty in time period AT is found by dividing the ieast-c count (L. ray of the time sacording
device by the number of vibrations.
“LC y :'

For example, the time recorded for 20 vibrations of a pelidhdiages t= 35.2s. Let the least count of
stop watch used is 0.1 s (1/10 s). So, the uncertainty in measured time is (35.2 s + 0.1 s).
Then the time period of the pendulum is obtained as:

*% Estimation does not mean guessing a formula ora number at random. An estimation isa
rough educated guess to the value of a physical quantity by using prior experience and sound
physical reasoning.

* Derived units can be expressed in terms of base units and are obtained by multiplying or
dividing base units.

* Dimension denotes the qualitative nature of a physical quantity.

“ In order to check the correctness of an equation, we have to show that both sides of an
equation have the same dimensions; otherwise, the equation cannot be physically correct.
This is called the principle of homogeneity of dimensions.

* Uncertainty is the Fane: of possible values within which the true value of the measurement
lies.

% Absolute uncertainty is equal to the least count of a measuring instrument.

In our daily life, we used to deal with physical quantities, such as mass, time, length, velocity,
acceleration, force, work and torque etc. Some physical quantities, known as scalars, can be
completely understood by a number and a proper unit only. On the other hand, some physical
quantities require direction along with a number and a unit; such quantities are known as
vectors. Displacement, force, acceleration, torque and momentum etc., are the examples of
vector quantities. Vectors are very useful in our daily life. For example, a signboard provides
information about distances and directions of other places relative to the location of the
signboard. Distance is a scalar quantity. Knowing the distance alone is not enough to get to the
desired location. We must also know the direction from the signboard to the destination. The
direction along with the distance, is a vector quantity called the displacement. Therefore,
signboards give information about displacement from the signboard to the destination.

Graphically, a vector can be completely expressed by a line with an arrow head. Length of the
line represents the magnitude according to the proper scale and the arrow head represents the
direction. We have studied about the addition of vectors in grade 9; here we shall study about
the components of vectors and about the products of vectors.

2.1 VECTOR RESOLUTION

Components are the effective parts of a vector in different directions. In 2-D, we take x-
component and y-component. The component along x-axis is called the horizontal or the x-
component and the component along the y-axis is called the vertical or the y-component. Both .
the x-component and y-component are perpendicular to each other and are called rectangular
components.

The components of a vector which are mutually perpendicular are called rectangular
Consider a vector ‘A’ making an angle ‘8’ with the _ yranis

Here, i and j are representing directions along +x-axis and  COMPonents of a vector.

vector and has magnitude equal to one.

2.1.1 Finding Magnitude of Rectangular Components

In order to find the magnitude of rectangular components A, and A, of a vector A, we apply the
trigonometric ratios. For this, consider the triangle OPQ, as shown in Fig. 2.1. As:

2.1.2 Finding a Vector from its Components

If the rectangular components Ax and Ay of a vector A are given, then its magnitude ‘A’ and
direction ‘6’ can be found. Again, we consider the triangle OPQ, as shown in Fig. 2.1. By
applying Pythagoras theorem, we get:

(OP)? = (0Q)* + (QP)? —— (2.5)

As QP = OS, so equation (2.5) can be written as: A vector which specifies

To find y-component of the force F, we use the equation:

Fy = F sin®
Putting values, we get:

2.2 PRODUCT OF WECTORS

—————eeax sa 6 2S OS aS ——_——_—--

When two vector quantities are multiplied, then the product may bea a ‘sealar quantity or a
vector quantity. The product obtained depends upon the nature of the given vectors. Let us
discuss the two types of products in the following sections.

2.2.1 Scalar Product or Dot Product:

When the product of two vector quantities gives a scalar
quantity then the product is called scalar product.

The scalar product of two vectors is represented by putting
a dot (-) between the symbols of the two vectors; therefore,
it is also Known as dot product.

Let us take two vectors A and B that are making an angle 6
with each other, as shown in the Fig. 2.2. The dot product

oes a ese two vectors can be denoted by A.B and is FI oak i Tie vectors Aas
° B re making an angle @ .

A-B=ABcos@ (2.9) with each other.

Here, A and B are the magnitudes of the vectors A and B. Thus, the scalar product of two
vectors is obtained by multiplying their magnitudes with the cosine of the angle between them.

Equation (2.9) can also be written as:
A-B=(Acos 8)B (2.10)

It is shown in the Fig. 2.3 that (A cos 6) is the component of vector A in the direction of vector
B. So, equation (2.10) can also be written as:

A - B = (component of vector A along B) B
Similarly; it can be shown that:

(2.11)

Hence, from equation (2.11) and (2.12), we can also define
scalar product as:

Properties of Scalar Product:
1) Scalar product of two vectors obeys the commutative property, i.e.,
A+B=ABcos8
=BAcos@=B-A

2) Scalar product of two orthogonal (perpendicular) vectors is equal to zero, i.e.,

Similarly, for mutually perpendicular unit vectors, we can show:

Note that the dot product of a vector with the null vector is also zero.

3) Scalar product of two parallel vectors has maximum value, and is equal to the product of
their magnitudes only. Hence:

calar product of a vector with itself is equal to the square of its magnitude, i.e.,

2.2.2 Vector Product or Cross Product:

When the product of two vector quantities gives a vector
quantity then the product is called vector product.

vector product of two vectors is represented by putting a
cross (x) between the symbols of the two vectors, therefore
it is also known as cross product.

Let us take two vectors A and B that are making ai angie 6
with each other, as shown in the Fig. 2.4. The cross product
between these two vectors can be denoted by AxB and is
defined as:

VECTORS

Here, A and B are the magnitudes of the vectors A and B. Thus, the vector product of two

vectors is obtained by multiplying their magnitudes with the sine of the angle between them. |
In equation (2.15), fi represents the direction of the vector
product, which is always perpendicular to the plane A |

containing A and B. The direction of cross product ( fi ) can be

found by right hand rule of vector product, as shown in Fig. ‘
2.5. It can be stated as:

Rotate the fingers of your right hand in the direction from

first vector to the second vector through smaller angle of the v

e Angular momentum (L) is also an example of vector

Properties of Vector Product:

(a null vector has zero magnitude and arbitrary direction). i.e., Figure = Ps us By

AxB=ABsinO& fi =O and AxB= = AB sin180° fi = 0 en dation :
Vector product of a vector with itself is equal to null vector. i.e., of vector product

Similarly, we can show that the vector product of a unit vector with itself is nuli vector. i.e.,
ixf=j~xj=kxk=0

product of their magnitudes only. Hence:

Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)

The students will:

* Derive the equations of motion [For uniform acceleration cases only. Derive from the definitions of velocity and acceleration
: as well as graphically].

¢ Solve problems using the equations of motion [For the cases of uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line, including the

motion of bodies falling in a uniform gravitational field without air resistance. This also includes situations where the
equations of motion need to be resolved into vertical and horizontal components for 2-D motion).

« Evaluate and analyse projectile motion in the absence of air resistance [This includes solving problems making use of the
below facts:
{i) Horizontal component (Vu) of velocity is constant.
(ii) Acceleration is in the vertical direction and is the same as that of a vertically free falling object.

(iil) The horizontal motion and vertical motion are independent of each other. Situations may require students to
determine for projectiles:

~ How high does it go?

- How far would it go along the level land?

- Where would it be after a given time?

- How long will it remain in flight?

Situations may also require students to calculate for a projectile launched from ground height the
- launch angle that results in the maximum range.

- relation between the launch angles that result in the same range.

The cover photo of this chapter shows an anti-ship missile being fired by Pakistan Navy in the
North Arabian Sea. The motion of a missile through the air can be described by its range,
velocity, and acceleration. When it flies, a short patch of its path can be considered a straight
line without any change in direction. However, its motion is not straight for long; instead, it is
a 2-dimensional motion under the action of gravity, called projectile motion. Similarly, all the
objects in this universe are in motion. Thus, understanding motion is also key to understanding
other concepts in physics. For example, an understanding of velocity is crucial to the study of
momentum. There are three types of motion: translational motion, rotational motion and
vibrational motion. In this chapter, we will concern ourselves only with translational motion,
such as motion along a straight line and projectile motion.

We begin with kinematics which is the branch of mechanics that deals with the study of motion
without considering the causes of motion. This includes the terms such as displacement,
velocity and acceleration in straight line. Using these terms, we study the motion of objects
undergoing constant acceleration. We begin with derivation of the equations of motion and
then we use them to solve problems of uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line, including
the motion of bodies falling in a uniform gravitational field without air resistance. It is also
extended to objects moving along c ved paths, such as projectile motion under the action of
gravity only and its applications. we deal with dynamics, which is the branch of mechanics
which deals with the study of forces that cause the objects and systems to move. This includes
momentum and associated law of conservation.

As shown in the graph that OA and BD are parallel sides, and OD is the distance between these

Putting OA = vi, BD = vy, and OD = t, we get:

Consider a body is moving with initial velocity vi ina straight line with constant acceleration a.

3.1.4 Free-Fall Motion O

An example of uniformly accelerated motion is the motion of a free-falling body. In the absence
of air resistance, all objects (lighter or heavier) fall freely near the surface of the Earth with
same acceleration, independent of their masses. This a ion is called acceleration due
to gravity, denoted by g. It has a value of 9.81 ms* and is dir owards centre of the Earth.

By substituting a = g and S =h in equations (3.2), (3.3) and we get the equations of
motion for free-fall as given below:

Using these equations, we can solve problems for the motion of bod

Till now, we have studied the motion of bodies in a straight line, either horizontal or vertical.

motion.

Projectile motion is a two-dimensional motion of an object thrown inthe air under the ac
of gravitational force only. PY USS
In our discussion of projectile motion, the effects of other forces, such as air friction and
rotation of the Earth, are neglected. The object that is thrown is called projectile and its path
is called its trajectory. A football, a cricket ball or a baseball when thrown in air are examples
of projectiles.

p= 4 ~

Experimentally, it can be proved that the horizontal and vertical motions are completely
independent of each other.

Consider the motion of two different
coloured balls, blue and green, as
shown in Fig. 3.3. The blue ball is
dropped vertically downward while the
green ball is thrown horizontally at the
same time from a cliff. Neglecting air
resistance, both the balls hit the ground
at the same time. The key to analyse
two-dimensional projectile motion is to
break the motion into two components,
one along the horizontal axis and other
along vertical axis.

3.2.1 Projectile Motion for
an Object Launched
Horizontally

In many situations, when a projectile is Figure 3.3: The two balls, one is thrown horizontally a and |
thrown horizontally from a certain other is thrown vertically down, hit the ground at the

height with some initial velocity, it subs henaece |
travels forward as well as falls downéd until it strikes the ground. Hence, neglecting air
resistance, the motion of the body follows projectile motion.

Consider the green ball is thrown horizontally from a cliff of certain height with velocity vi, as
shown in Fig. 3.3. There is no vertical component J the initial siti i.€., Viy = 0. Hence:

litialHOrizontal’ Component of velocity = Vix = vi fr ne
Lyertical component of velocity=Vy=0 ye
Thus, there is no horizontal acceleration, while the vertical bash eration is the acceleration

due to gravity, i.e.,

Acceleration due to gravity g is taken positive when the ball is falling BondGvard wn viaaatoi
when the ball is moving upward.

The horizontal component of velocity remains constant, while the vertical component of
velocity increases. So, at any instant ¢, its velocity components are:

Vertical component ” velocity is:

Hence, the magnitude of instantaneous velocity ¢ is given by:

And the vertical displacement, as the body moves downward from the height is given by:

3.2.2 Projectile Motion for an Object Launched at Some Angle with
Horizontal

There are many situations in which a projectile (object) is thrown with velocity v, at an angle
6 with the horizontal. After given an initial push, it moves under the action of force of gravity,
as shown in Fig. 3.4. Here, the air resistance is
neglected.

There is no horizontal acceleration, while the —
vertical acceleration is the acceleration due to |
gravity, i.e., - camer’

Resolve the initial velocity into its horizontal and
‘ vertical components:

The horizontal component of velocity remains
constant, while the vertical component of
velocity changes. So, at any instant t, its velocity components are expressed as:

Horizontal component of velocity is:

Vertical component of velocity is:

° v; cos8 > ¢

--- PAGE 40 ---
Vty = Viy + ayt

Hence, magnitude of instantaneous velocity at any instant t is given by:

The direction @ of instantaneous velocity v, is determined as:

At instant t, t zontal displacement x covered by the body is given by:

We will describe the saseeeies height, th
sections.
Height of the Projectile H:

The height of the projectile is the maximum
vertical distance attained during the projectile
motion. It is denoted by H, as shown in Fig. 3.5.
To determine H, we use the third equation of
motion as;

2ayH = vz - vz (3.14)
It may be noted that at maximum height, vy =

0, since the body momentarily comes to rest. Also, for a ‘naka moving upw d, ay=-g
and equation (3.14) becomes: <)

2(-—g)H = 0 - Viy
Since, vjy = vj sin® so, we get: —2gH=0- v/sin’0

By arranging, we get:

- .

Using this equation, we can find the height of the projectile if the magnitude and direction of
the initial velocity is known.
Time of flight T:

The time taken by the projectile from the point of projection to the point where it hits the
ground at same level is called the time of flight. It is denoted by T. To determine T, we use
the second equation of motion:

| s=vyt+ =a ag
For y-direction, equation (3.16) becomes:
H = viyt+ —ayt?
Since, the projectile returns to ground (same height), so we take H = 0. Substituting a, =
—, Viy = yj sind and t = T in above equation, we get:
. 0 = ¢v; sind) T— + gT?

(3.16)

By rearranging, we get

If magnitude and direction of the initial velocity is known, then this equation can be used to
find the time of flight of the pro e.

The time taken by the projectile to reach the highest point is called the time of summit. It is
denoted by T’ and is given by:

Range of the Projectile R: y

The horizontal distance travelled by a projectile is called range. It is denoted by R. To
determine R, we use the relation, S = vt. As the range is horizontal distance, so we can write:

X= Vy t
‘ 2v, sind ! .
Substituting X = R,v, = v; cos6 and t = T = —1—— in above equation, we get:
: Cr, Woy
R =v, cos@ x =e * J
g SF

This equation can be used to find range of a projectile, if magnitude and direction of initial
velocity are known. Thus, by knowing two quantities; magnitude and direction of initial
velocity, we can find height, range and time of flight for the projectile.

Maximum Range Rmax: The greater the initial speed, the greater the range. For a given value
of initial velocity v,, the range of the projectile is maximum if sin20 = 1, which occurs when

3 3.3 LA LAW OF CONSERVATION OF MOMENT UM.

if & orton a system consists of particles, each moving with different velocities, then the total
momentum of an isolated system is the sum of the momenta of the individual particles. A
system is said to be isolated if and only if the net external force, such as the gravitational force
or friction, acting on the system is zero. There is no ideally isolated system in the universe, but
we consider an isolated system that does not interact with its environment. The law of
conservation of momentum states as:

[D_ The total momentum 9 of an isolated system of inkerneting particles is conserved.

If p; and py are initial and final momenta of an isolated system, then according to law of
conservation dhol momentum

The law of conservation of m momentum is Cpatul in collision problems. When a collision occurs
in an isolated system due to internal forces, the momentum of each particle changes. Such
forces do not contribute to the net force, which remains zero. Hence, the total momentum of
the system does not change with the passage of time. | It is also applicable in explosions.

3.3.1 Applications of Conservation of Momentum

in an explosion, chemical energy (stored in |
the bonds of the atoms) is transformed into |
the kinetic energy of the fragments. Using the —
principles of conservation of momentum, |
numerical values can be predicted for the |
.

|

fragments after the explosion.

All objects before an explosion are generally |
considered at rest. After and during the | m
explosion, the objects fly away in different | po Sl a ~~ Ig |
directions with different speeds. Momentum sf om
is always conserved; in this case, the initial — vy ro Vv»
momentum of everything is zero. Knowing 8

this, the final momentum should be zero too. reals 3.7 > ‘Explosion of a bomb into two “A
Consider the explosion of a bomb into two | fragments A and B

fragments identified as A and B, as shown in

Fig. 3.7 (a). The initial momentum of the system before the explosion is Zero. As the momentum
must be conserved, so sum of the final momentum of the two fragments must be zero.

44

--- PAGE 45 ---
=e TRANSLATORY MOTION se Be

Therefore, the fragments of same masses must move in opposite directions with equal speed
for their momentum to be conserved.

An explosion in a cannon also follows conservation of momentum. For example, consider a
cannon on a frictionless ground shooting a cannon ball, as shown in Fig. 3.7 (b).

fv oa

The sum of initial momentum is zero, because nothing is moving.
After explosion inside the cannon, the cannon ball will be shot
forward at very high speed, while the cannon recoils at a much
slower speed due to its heavy mass. Sum of the final momentum will
be zero, this makes the initial momentum and the final momentum
equal.

al explosions, objects move apart instead of coming together like] | P
in collision.

A karate player can break a pile of tiles with. a a single blow because

he strikes the pile with his hand very fast, as shown in Fig. 3.8 (a).

In doing so, the large momentum of his hand is reduced to zero in a

very short time interval. This exerts a large force on the pile of tiles

which is sufficient to break them apart.

Conservation of momentum is also applied on ball and bat. When a
ball hits on the bat, the total momentum before and after the
collision must be equal (You have to add up the momentum of ball
and bat). So, the momentum of ball and bat before and after the
collision must be equal, as shown in Fig 3.8 (b).

Rockets and jet engines also work on the law of conservation of
momentum. In these machines, hot gases produced by burning of |
fuel rush out with large momentum. As a result, the machines gain
an equal and opposite momentum. This enables them to move with |
very high velocity.

Conservation of momentum is also applied when two car hits each
other. Net momentum of cars before and after the collision must be
equal.

3.4 ELASTIC AND INELASTIC COLLISIO

A collision occurs when two bodies come in physical contact with each other for a short interval
of time and then separate. For example, the collision of ball with a bat, the collision of two
cars, etc. There are two types of collisions: Elastic collision and inelastic collision. Momentum
remains conserved in all types of collisions, but kinetic energy may change.

3.4.1 Elastic Collision

Consider an isolated system consisting of two spherical bodies such as billiard balls of masses m, and
m; initially moving towards right with velocities u, and uz along a straight line without rotation. The
speed of body having mass m, is greater than speed of body having mass mz and is approaching to it.
So, the two bodies encounter head-on elastic collision. After collision they move with velocities v;
and v, along the same straight line, as shown in Fig. 3.9.

a}. .20 — —_———
_ Figure 3.9: Two balls: (a) before coltston (b) during colision(c) after colision:

We take the velocity as positive if a body is moving towards right and negative if it is moving
towards left. Since the collision is elastic, therefore, we have two conservation laws in this
case. According to the law of conservation of momentum:

m,U, + Mgu2 = mV, + M2V2 ee
After rewriting the above equation, we have:

mW; — MVy = M2Vv2— M2U2

m,(u; — v1) = m2 (v2 — Uz) (3.23)
Similarly, according to the law of conservation of kinetic energy, we get:
After cancelling the factor 1/2, rewrite the above equation:

m, (uz — v7) = mz (v3 — ug)
m,(u; — Vi)(uy + Vy) = m2(v2— U2)(v2 + U2)
Dividing equation (3.24) by (3.23), we get: Wg

uy + Vy = V2 + ug
or / Uy — Ug = V2 - Vi

This equation shows that relative speed of two bodies before sere on is equal but opposite to

relative speed after collision. Hence, for two bodies colliding elastically, the relative speed of
approach before collision is equal to the relative speed of separation after collision. From
equation (3.25), we get: Vz = uy + Vy — Ug (3.26)
By putting the value of v, from equation (3.25) into the equation (3.22), we get:

m,U, + mzUz = m,v, + m,(u, + vy — U2)

Case 1: When the two colliding bodies have the same mass i.e., m, = Mz, then from equations
(3.27) and (3.29), we get:

Vi = U2 and V2= Wy
This shows that velocities of bodies exchange during elastic collision of two bodies having equal
masses.
Case 2: When bodies have the same mass i.e., m; = m2, and the second body (target) is at rest
(uz = 0), then from equations (3.27) and (3.29), we get:

v, = 0 and V2 = Uy
This shows that when the first body comes to rest the ‘second body moves with the initial
velocity of the first body.
Case 3: When a lighter body (m,) collides with a massive body (m2 >> m,) at rest (u, = 0), then
under such condition m, can be neglected i.e,, m, = 0, so from equations (3.27) and (3.29), we
get:

vy, = —Uy and = 0
Hence the first body (which is lighter) rebounds with the aa initial velocity but in opposite
direction. The second body (which is heavier) remain at rest even after collision. For example,
if a ball is thrown at a fixed wall, the ball will bounce back with the same velocity, it had
initially, but in the opposite direction.
Case 4: When a massive body (m;) collides with a lighter body (m, > m2) at rest (u2 = 0), then
under such condition m, can be neglected i.e., mz = 0, so from equations (3.27) and (3.29), we
get: (

Vi = Wy and V2 =2uy,

Hence, the first body (which is heavier) continues to move with the same initial velocity. While
the second body (which is lighter) will move with twice the initial velocity of the first body.
Example 3.7: An object of mass 5 kg moving at 10 ms" collides with another object of mass
40 kg moving in the same direction at 5 ms". Assume that the collision saoe-cmestonal
elastic collision. What will be the speed of both objects after the collision?

SUMMARY

* Equations of motion show the relation between initial pe final velocity, acceleration,
displacement and time.

* Projectile motion is a two-dimensional motion of an object thrown in the air under the
action of gravitational force only. In projectile motion horizontal component of velocity
remains constant, while the vertical component of velocity changes.

* The height of the projectile is the maximum vertical distance attained by it during
projectile motion.

* The time taken by the projectile to reach the maximum height and then return to the ground

_ is called the time of flight.

* The horizontal distance travelled by a projectile is called range. A projectile has the same
range for complementary angles. -

* The law of conservation of momentum states, the total momentum of an isolated system
of interacting particles is conserved.

* An elastic collision is a collision in which both the momentum and the kinetic energy of the
system are conserved.

* An inelastic collision is a collision in which the momentum is conserved but kinetic energy
is not conserved,

TZ ROTATIONAL AND CIRCULAR MOTION

Rotational motion is the turning or spinning motion of an object about an axis that passes
through it. For rotational motion of rigid objects, which are non-deformable and the particles
forming it stay in fixed positions relative toone 200 ‘
another as an object is rotated, we consider an Rotation Axis |

axis of rotation. Axis of rotation is a line about
which rotation takes place. This line remains
fixed during rotational motion, while the other
points of the body move in circles about it.

The axis of rotation may be a pivot, hinge or any | —
other support. Every point in a rotating rigid _ : "Figure 4.1: ‘Axis of rotation. eee |

4.1.5 Relationship between Linear and Angular Kinematic Quantities

Linear kinematic quantities like displacement, velocity and acceleration can be related with

particle that moves in circle of radius ‘r’ with center at ‘O’. Let the particle moves from point

Radial Component: The component of acceleration iii angular motion which is along radius of
the circular path is radial component of acceleration. This acceleration arises due to change in
direction of linear instantaneous velocity. For an object moving in a circular path with constant
speed, there is only the radial acceleration, also called centripetal acceleration.

with an initial velocity of 6.80 ms"'. Assuming constant angular acceleration, the tyre comes
to rest at a distance of 74.8 m. Determine (a) initial angular velocity of the tyre; (b) the

4.2 CENTRIPETAL ACCELERATION AND CENTRIPETAL FORCE

Consider a particle is moving in a circular path of radius r with constant speed, this means that
direction of velocity is changing. This change in velocity of the particle produces acceleration
which is directed towards the center of the circle, this type of acceleration is called centripetal
acceleration.

Consider the Fig. 4.9 (a) in which a particle follows a circular path. The particle is at point A
at time t; with velocity v,. It reaches at point B at a later time t, with velocity vr. For uniform

circular motion v, and v, differ only in direction; their magnitudes are same, i.e. \v,| = \v,| = \v|

According to Newton’s second law, an object that is accelerating must have a net force acting
on it. for example, to open a door, force must be applied to produce tangential acceleration
thereby creating torque. Similarly, for an object to move in a circle, a force must be applied
to it to keep it moving in that circle. Thereby giving it necessary radial (centripetal)
acceleration.

4.2.1 Centripetal Force
The net force that causes the particle to undergo centripetal acceleration is called Lentrinetay

force Fe. ,
When Newton’s second law i. opted toa particle moving in a uniform circular motion, we can

write: F. = —___ (4.20)
Putting equation (4.18) or sanetibe (4.19) in equation (4.20), we can write centripetal force F,
2 a
as: ‘> Fe= oak j
r

The direction of the pe force is always wured towards the center of the circle.
Centripetal force is not a new force, but any net force that makes an object move towards the
center of the circle can be termed as centripetal force. For example, to swing a ball in a circle
at the end of a string, the tension in the string act as centripetal force. For a moon revolving
around the Earth, or planets revolving around the Sun, gravity act as centripetal force. In other
en it can be a normal force, or even an electric force (as in CD players and computer
ard disks).

Frictional force and normal force as centripetal force:

When a car travels without skidding around an un-banked curve, the static frict*onal force
between the tyres and the road provides the necessary centripetal force. The reliance on
friction can be eliminated completely for a given speed, if the roads are banked at an angle
relative to the horizontal while making a turn (Fig. 4.10).

component ‘Fy sin8’ that points toward the center ‘C’ of the circle and provides the centripetal
force.

In the Fig. 4.10 (a) part shows a Car going around a friction-free banked curve. The radius of
the curve is ‘r’, where ‘r’ is measured parallel to the horizontal. Part (b) of the figure shows
the normal force ‘Fy’ that the road applies on the car, the normal force is perpendicular to the
road. Because the roadbed makes an angle ‘8’ with respect to the horizontal, the normal force
has a component ‘Fx sin 6’ that points toward the center C of the circle and provides the
centripetal force.

low for a given ‘8’, a car would slide down a frictionless banked curve; at a speed that is too
higher, a car would slide off the curve.

Dividing equation (4.22) by this equation, we get:

Tension force as centripetal force:
When objects are connected by a string or
rope and moving in a circle, the tension in
the string acts as the centripetal force. |
The tension in the string is responsible to
provide the necessary centripetal force, |
as it pulls the objects towards the center
of the circle, preventing them from
meving in a straight line and causing them
to follow a curved path instead. For |
example, to swing a ball in acircle onthe |
end of a string, the tension in the string | |
act as centripetal force, as shown in Fig. Side view Top view

is provided by tension ‘T’ in the string - force.

such that: a a:

The magnitude of the tension in the string is directly related to the speed of the objects and
the radius of the circle. As the speed of the objects or the radius of the circle increases, the
tension in the string must also increase in order to provide the necessary centripetal force to
keep the objects moving in a circular path.

4.3 MOMENT OF INERTIA

The property of a body by which it maintains
its state of rest or uniform rotational motion
' about a fixed axis is called moment of inertia .
(or rotational inertia).
The moment of inertia (or rotational inertia)
is the rotational equivalent of mass. Objects
with larger mass have a larger inertia,
meaning that they are harder to accelerate
linearly. Similarly, an object with a larger
moment of inertia is harder to angularly
accelerate. The moment of inertia is given

.A spinning ice skater is an interesting

example of conservation of angular |
momentum. When the skater’s arms |
are extended, the rotational inertia
‘l’ is relatively large and the angular
velocity ‘w’ is relatively small, as
shown in Fig. 4.16. Often at the end
of the spin, the skater pulls his arms ~
close to hié body resulting in a much
faster spin (larger angular velocity)
because of a much smaller rotational |
inertia. When a_ rotating body ©
contracts, its angular velocity |
increases; and when a rotating body |
expands, its angular velocity |
decreases. This phenomenon is the —

67

--- PAGE 68 ---
result of the conservation of angular momentum. As:

And moment of inertia is given by: / = mr?

Therefore, = m,F7 wr = mr? w
As r, <r, and m, =, therefore his rotational speed

will increase to compensate for the decrease in
rotational inertia. .

Similarly, gymnasts and divers generate their spins
(torque) from a solid base or a diving board after which
the angular momentum remains unchanged, as shown
in Fig. 4.17. The usual somersaults and twists result by
making variations in their rotational inertia.

A gyroscope is a device that utilizes the principle of
angular momentum to maintain its orientation relative
to the Earth's axis or resist changes in its orientation.
A very unusual and fascinating type of motion you
probably have observed is that of a gyroscope, which
utilize the principle of angular momentum.

Gyroscope usually consists of a wheel mounted on an
axle which can rotate freely and is secured in a metal
frame, as shown in Fig. 4.18 (a). When the wheel is
made to spin the gyroscope can be balanced mounted

keep levitated without falling, but will start precession about gravitational force axis. This is
the gravity-defying part of a gyroscope, as shown in the Fig. 4.18 (b).

This unusual behaviour can be explained by the vector nature of angular momentum, the change
in direction of gyroscope will require a torque. The torque is provided by gravitational force as
its weight towards the ground. The angular momentum will start to follow the torque, as shown
in the Fig. 4.18 (c), the change in angular momentum ‘AL’ is:

AG=etrxAt _
Where the torque has the same direction as ‘AL’ and ‘At’ is the duration of time. The same
effects can also be observed even if it is lifted by string looped around its lower end,

A flywheel (as shown in Fig 4.19) is a mechanical
component that stores energy by spinning a heavy disc
or wheel about an axle. When torque is applied, the
rotational speed increases, storing kinetic energy that
can be used for different tasks. The concept of a
flywheel is based on the principle of conservation of
energy, where the energy input is stored in the form of |
rotational motion. This stored. energy can then be
released when needed, such as during power outages or
to provide additional power for machinery.

Flywheels are commonly used in various applications,
such as in engines, industrial machinery, and energy Geared Teeth
storage systems. In vehicles, flywheels can help smooth Figure 4.19: Flywheel.

out the power delivery and improve fuel efficiency. In

industrial settings, they can provide backup power and help regulate the speed of machinery.

The design of a flywheel involves careful consideration of the material, size, and shape of the
disc or wheel, as well as the bearings and axle to minimize friction and maximize energy
storage. Additionally, the speed and torque at which the flywheel operates must be carefully
controlled to ensure safe and efficient operation.

chest the angular velocity will increase.

Can you explain why does this happens?

In recent years, there has been growing interest in using flywheels as a form of energy storage
for renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power. By storing excess energy generated

during peak production times, flywheels can help balance the supply and demand of electricity
on the grid.

of radius 31 cm rotating at 1150 rpm? (b) How much torque is required to stop it in 7.8 s?

Given: Mass 'm’ = 3.6 kg Radius ‘R' = 31 cm = 0.31 m

4.5 TORQUE AND ANGULAR ACCELERATION

Relationship exists between torque and angular
acceleration, just like force and acceleration as in
Newton’s second law of motion.

4.5.1 For a Point Mass

Consider a mass ‘m’ rotating at a distance ‘r’ from the
axis of rotation, as shown in Fig. 4.20. The force ‘F’
acting on the mass to rotate it is a tangential force. By
definition of torque, we have:

(4.44) ee,

t=rF sind A ‘

Since 6 = 90° and sin90°=1, magnitude of cquation 1 will Nittetecerecsatl :

become: tT =rF (4.45) Figure 4.20: Mass ‘m’ rotating at
distance ‘r’ from axis of rotation.

According to Newton’s second Law, F =ma

(4.46)

The relation between tangential and angular sccoleration’ is given by:

te

Putting equation (4.47) in equation (4.46), we get:

F=mra (4.48)

Putting equation (4.48) in equation (4.45), we get:

(4.49) . RET:

ea r=r(mra) or r=mra

cai the term mr? is moment of inertia, therefore,

Sn ee r=la (4.50)

Equations (4.50) states that torque is moment of inertia times angular acceleration. This
statement is similar to Newton’s second law of motion F = ma, which gives force as equal to
inertia (mass) times acceleration.

4.6 WEIGHTLESSNESS IN SATELLITES

Weightlessness occurs when the feeling of weight is completely or almost completely absent,
meaning there is zero apparent weight. This occurs during free-fall, when the force of gravity
is balanced out by the inertial force from orbital flight, like centrifugal force.

In a weightless environment, objects and individuals float freely, as there is no force pulling
them towards the ground. This phenomenon is commonly experienced by astronauts in space,
where they appear to be float inside their spacecraft with objects around them.

The term zero gravity is often used incorrectly to describe weightlessness, as astronauts in
space stations are not in gravity free environment high above the Earth, 250 miles out in space,
where most space stations orbit, the gravitational field is still quite strong there roughly 95%
of its at on surface of the Earth. Weightlessness
can be achieved in two ways. One that to travel
millions of miles from gravitational force of large
object, where the gravitational force reduces to
nearly zero. Or the second and much more
practical is to create weightless environment
through act of free fall. The space stations are in
constant free fall, having the right speed and at
right altitude. Inside the space station the
astronaut is also falling free, so they appear to
float, as shown in Fig. 4.21, and physicists call it
weightlessness.

Figure 4.21: Weightlessness in satellites.

Weightlessness can be enjoyed in amusement parks momentarily; it can also be simulated on
Earth through techniques such as parabolic flights or neutral buoyancy tanks, allowing
researchers to study the effects of microgravity on the human body and various materials. Living
in a space station is not easy, besides the dangers of space travel and time spent away from
family in isolation, astronauts feel many health issues related to microgravity. Their bones and
muscles get weakened, cardiovascular system is affected and immune system is compromised.

Apart from all these health challanges some everyday activities become near-impossible. Their
basic necessities like eating, sleeping, and showering habits are modified. They even can’t cry;
they face difficulty in digesting food and even in urination and excretion. Rotational simulated
gravity has been proposed as a solution in human spaceflight to the adverse health effects
caused by prolonged weightlessness.

Even though things and people may feel weightless in a weightless setting, they still possess
mass and inertia, causing them to maintain their straight-line motion unless an outside force
intervenes.

It can be generated by rotating a space-station around its own axis, as shown in Fig. 4.22. The
surface of the rotating space station exerts a force on objects
with in contact with it and thereby provides the centripetal
force that keeps the object moving on a circular path. In space
stations, the astronauts feel weightless and cannot work
effectively. In order to overcome this difficulty artificial
gravity can be provided by rotating it about its own axis.

To describe artificial gravity, consider a circular tube shaped
part of the space station in which artificial gravity will be
provided to the occupants of the space station. Let it have the Figure 4.22: Artificial gravity.

SUMMARY

* Angular velocity: The rate at which an object changes the angle while moving on a circular
path.

* Tangential acceleration: The acceleration in a direction tangent to the circle at the point
of interest in circular motion.

* Angular acceleration: The rate of change of angular velocity with respect to time.

* Centripetal Bceenyapon: The acceleration of an object moving in a circle, directed toward
the center.

« Centripetal force: Any net force causing uniform circular motion.

** Moment of inertia: Mass times the square of perpendicular distance from the rotation axis;
for a point mass, it is | = mr? and, because any object can be built up from a collection of
point masses, this relationship is the basis for all other moments of inertia.

* Torque: The turning effectiveness of a force and is defined as product of moment of inertia
and angular acceleration (t= Ia).

* Angular momentum: The product of moment of inertia and angular velocity (L = Iw).

* Angular momentum is conserved, i.e., the initial angular momentum is equal to the final
angular momentum when no external torque is applied to the system.

UNIT 5 WORK AND ENERGY

In the sport of weightlifting, the task is to pick up a very large mass, lift it over our head, and
hold it there at rest for a moment. This action is an example of doing work by lifting and
lowering a mass. Weightlifting requires energy from the body's metabolic processes, specifically
from the breakdown of a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Additionally,
weightlifting can also utilize stored glycogen in muscle tissue, which can be broken down into
glucose to provide energy.

5.1 WORK

The work done on an object is the scalar (or dot)
iii of force F and ini d.

Panu

In main (5.1), ‘F’ is hd magnitude of force,
‘d’ is the magnitude of displacement, and ‘0’ — Ipetre 5.1: Work done eT
is the angle between force. and the —

displacement. From the Fig. 5.1, we.can see | (a)

that the force can be resolved into two |
components Fcos@ and Fsin@. Here, Fcos @isthe —
component of force along the direction of |
displacement which is the effective component. _
Whereas, Fsin@ is the component of force which
is perpendicular to the _ direction of ,
displacement and therefore plays no role in |
doing work. | |

Units of Work: The SI unit of work is the joule
(J) (named in honor of the 19th-century English
physicist James Prescott Joule). From above
equation we see that the unit of work is the unit
of force multiplied by the unit of distance. In SI |
the unit of force is the newton and the unit of
distance is the metre, so 1 joule is equivalent to
1 newton-metre ii bint

bepenilenesa of Work: The work done depends
upon force ‘F’, displacement ‘d’ and the angle

a) Positive Work: When the force has a

component in the same direction as the displacement (0° < 6 < 90°), cos 6 in above equation is
positive and the work W is positive.

WORK AND ENERGY (

b) Negative Work: When the force has a component opposite to the displacement (90° < 6s

180°), cos 6 is negative and work done by the force will be negative.

c) Zero Work: When the force is perpendicular to the displacement, 6 = 90° then the work

done by the force is zero.

Work Done from Force-Displacement Graph: The area
under the force-displacement graph gives the work done.

A. Work Done by Constant Force: In Fig. 5.3, graph for a constant
force to produce net displacement is shown, here the blue shaded
area of rectangle represent work done by the constant force.

B. Work Done by Variable Force: In Fig. 5.4, graph with increasing
force to produce net displacement is shown, here the blue shaded
area of triangle represent work done by the increasing force.

However, in many situations of daily life, the force is variable in
many different ways, and therefore we get different graphs for area
under the curve for work done by such forces.

For example, when we stretch a spring, the more we stretch it, the
harder we have to pull, so the force we exert is not constant as the
spring is stretched. When a rocket moves away from Earth the work
is done against the force of gravity which varies as inverse of the
square of distance from the center of Earth.

Consider a graph in Fig. 5.5, is drawn between Fcos@ and d. To find
the total work done, we divide the displacement into number of
small displacements Ad;, Adz, Ad3, ., Ada, with corresponding
effective component of forces are F; cos®;, F2 cos@2, F3 COSB3, scdesrsee,

the inclined plane makes an angle of 20° with the Earth, find the work done against gravity.

5.2 CONERVATIVE & NON-CONSERVATIVE FIELDS

force field. Examples include electric field, viscous field and —

properties: A A

2. Work Done around a Closed Path is Zero: If the work done
on a particle moving through any closed path (the path in-which the beginning and end points
are same) gives zero, as shown in Fig. 5.6 (b), such a field will be conservative.

Gravitational and electric fields are examples of conservative fields and the associated forces
are conservative forces.

Frictional field is a non-conservative field, and frictional or drag fovea a are non-conservative
forces because when an object is moved in frictional field, the work done against frictional
force depends upon the path followed.

Frictional force, viscous drag and air resistance are all examples of non- “conservative forces and
the fields where they act are termed as non-conservative fields.

WORK AND ENERGY

A boy kicks a football; it moves because it possess Kinetic energy. Now think a tennis ball and
a football moving with same speed. Which possess greater ability to do work? Of course, the
football with larger mass, which is difficult to stop. Similarly, now two footballs are approaching
you with different speeds, which can do more work? Again, the football with greater speed is
difficult to stop. Thus, the object’s mass and its speed contribute to its Kinetic energy. Like all
energies, Kinetic energy is also a scalar quantity.

Consider a situation in which all the work done transfers only kinetic energy to a cricket ball.
Let the cricket ball is initially at rest v;= 0 m/s, and a horizontal force F is applied to move it
through a displacement ‘d' and achieve a final velocity vy = v, as shown in Fig. 5.7. This work
done W appears as the kinetic energy K.E. Such =

Putting equations (5.5) and (5.6) in
equation (5.4), we get: .

(5.7)

KE=5m(v3 -v7)

As the object (cricket ball) started from rest therefore vy; = 0 and v; = v.

Therefore, KE = mv4_ (5.8) ik Rees {
Although derived for cricket ball, the equation (5.8) in mah? 4 shows the relation for the kinetic
energy of any moving object. For example, an iron ball of 1.0 kg moving with a speed of 2.0
ms" has a Kinetic energy of 2 J.

Equally important, it demonstrate the work kinetic energy theorem which states that work done
on an object is equal to change in energy i.e. W = AE, where 'W is the work done and AE is the
change in energy.

5.4 WORK - ENERGY PRINCIPLE

Since work is defined as the movement of an object through a distance, energy can also be
described as the ability to move an object through a distance. The net work done on an object
is equal to the change in the object's kinetic energy, i.e.,

Where, the change in the kinetic energy is due to the objects een in speed.

Work-Energy Theorem is also valid for potential energy. However, potential energy cannot be
defined only for conservative forces.

In situations where potential energy can be defined, change in potential energy is exactly equal

5.4.1 Work - Energy Theorem in Resistive Medium

Why is a skydiver quite confident when using a parachute? Probably she relies on balance
between resistive forces and her weight. A resistive force on a moving object opposes the
motion of the object or prevent a stationary object from moving, for example friction, viscous
force etc.

When forces are acting on an object, energy transformations occur, which means the work is
being done. The work done ‘W’ on an object by an applied force ‘F’ is the sum of the gain in
kinetic energy ‘AK.E’ of the object and the work done by the object against the resistive force
‘W,’. That is:

Ws AK.E + W,

The work done by the object against the resistive force takes energy away from the object,
partons Ft its kinetic energy. pgmatically

Both Newton’s laws and work energy theorem can be used to solve ney eae However, if the
forces are not constant, Newton’s laws will be difficult to apply.

5.4.2 implications of Energy Loses in Practical Devices and Efficiency

.Input of Mechanical Machine: The energy supplied to a mechanical machine is called input.
Input is equal to the product of effort ‘ a and the wii ‘d’, through which effort acts (Fig.
5.8).

Output of Mechanical Machine: The work done by a mechanical machine
‘ is called output. Output is the product of load ‘W’ and the sag ‘D’
through which the ae lifts.

Efficiency: The efficiency, is the ratio of work output to the work input,
and can be it ncaa in percentage as:
iit. __ useful energy output ”
energyinput

Efficiency is oie ened of similar qu quantities and therefore has no unit.

The efficiency cannot be greater than 1 (or 100%), in fact it cannot be Em :
equal to 1 (or 100%) for real machines. In case of pulley system, the efficiency is only 40%, rest
of the 60% goes into waste and converted into unwanted forms of energy.

Ideal Machine: For an ideal machine only, the input will be equal to output, this means that
no energy is wasted and all energy is converted into useful work. Therefore, the efficiency of
an ideal machine is 100 %.

--- PAGE 84 ---
WORK AND ENERGY

Almost all energy transformation technologies operate at efficiencies less than 100 %, most of
the wasted energy becomes thermal energy. Table 5) 4ioTypicaverficiencies of enere

For example, automobiles are highly inefficient.

Only about 10% (or 100 J) of useful work is done in producing the kinetic energy of the moving
car; rest of the energy is wasted in engine and cars transmission. Some other examples of
energy losses in practical devices are given in Table 5.1.

The rocket's total energy at the top of its flight is 2352 J. (a) What was the rocket's

It is well known that liquids and gases belong to fluids. The air we breathe and the water we
drink are fluids. An important fluid, blood is flowing in our body’s veins, flow of which is
essential for life. Life would not exist without fluids and without the behavior that fluids
exhibit. Why does rising smoke curl and twist? How does a nozzle increase the speed of water
emerging from a hose? How does an airplane gain lift while accelerating on the runway? Fluid
mechanics allows us to answer these and many other questions.

In Grade-IX, we have dealt with many situations in which fluids are static. In this chapter, we
will deal mainly with the flow of fluid. Fluid mechanics is the branch of physics in which we
study about the fluid, either static or dynamic. Studying the fluid in motion is called fluid
dynamics. The study of fluids in motion is relatively complex, but analysis can be simplified by
making few assumptions such as fluid under consideration is non-viscous, incompressible and
its motion is steady. The analysis is further simplified by the use of two important conservation
principles, the conservation of mass and conservation of energy. The law of conservation of
mass gives us the equation of continuity, while the law of conservation of energy forms the
basis of Bernoulli’s equation. The equation of continuity and the Bernoulli’s equation along with
their numerous applications in everyday life, including sports, transportation and technology
are discussed in this unit.

6.1 UPTHRUST AND ARCHIMEDES PRINCIPLE

Have you ever thought that: Why
do heavy ships float on water
surface? How does the balloon fly
in sky? Why does a mug filled with
water feels lighter under water,
but feel heavy as soon as we take
it out of water? Why do some
objects float while others do not?

Answers to all these questions are
based on the fact that pressure
increases with depth in a fluid. So,
the upward force on the bottom of

an object in a fluid is greater than (a) Bb ees “(b)
the downward force on the top of Figure 6.1: (a) A heavy ship float on the surface of water.

force, called buoyant force or up-thrust, on any object in any fluid. If the up-thrust is greater
than the object’s weight, the object will rise to the surface and float. If the up-thrust is less,
than the object’s weight, the object will sink. If the up-thrust equals the object’s weight, the
object will remain suspended at that depth. The up-thrust is always present whether the object
floats, sinks, or is suspended in a fluid. Due to up-thrust an air-filled balloon immediately shoots
up to the surface when released under water.

Archimedes principle help us to calculate magnitude of up-thrust. It states that:

Here, Ah = V is the volume of the cylinder and is equal to the volume of the liquid displaced by

So, | Upthrust = weight of the liquid displaced ‘$6

Equation (6.1) is the mathematical form of the Archimedes’ principle. Archimedes principle is
also helpful to calculate the density of an object.

Ships: Ships are engineered to float in the sea by employing several fundamental principles
and design elements: buoyancy, stability and structural reliability.

so Eat

a) Buoyancy: Ships are designed to displace a volume of water equal to their weight, allowing
them to float. This is achieved by creating a hull shape that maximizes displacement while
minimizing weight. The hull is designed to withstand water pressure, which increases with
depth. The hull is shaped to displace water, creating an upward buoyant force (Fp) equal to the
weight of the ship (W)., i.e.,

Fo=pVg=W

> = atl

b) Stability: Ships are engineered to resist overturning by distributing weight low, using ballast
tanks, and designing a stable hull shape.

c) Structural Reliability: The ship's structure is engineered to withstand stresses, Aaa: and
vibrations using strong, lightweight materials like steel and aluminum.

By combining these principles and design elements, ships are engineered to float and operate
safely in the sea.

Submarines: Submarine can travel over as well as under water. It floats over water when the
weight of water equal to its volume is greater than its weight. Under this condition, it is similar
to a ship and travel.over water. It has a system of tanks which can be filled with and emptied
of seawater. When these tanks are filled with seawater, the weight of the submarine increases.
As soon as the weight becomes greater than the up-thrust, it sinks and remains under water.
To return to the surface, the tanks are emptied from seawater.

Example 6.1: A cubic block of wood is completely dipped in water. Calculate the
up-thrust of water acting on it if each side of the block is 10 cm long.

Given: | L= 10cm ==> m=0.1m
To Find: Upthrust =?
Solution: According to the Archimedes’ principle, upthrust is given by the formula:
Upthrust = pg V
For cube, V = L?, so above equation becomes:
Upthrust = pg (L)? ;
Here for water, we use p = 1000 kgm”, putting values, we get:
Upthrust = 1000x9.8 (0.1)?
Upthrust = 9.8 N

6.2 VISCOUS DRAG AND TERMINAL VELOCITY

Viscosity is measure of fluid’s resistance to flow. A more viscous fluid pours slowly while a less
viscous pours easily. Imagine a Styrofoam cup with a hole in the bottom. If you pour honey into
the cup, the cup drains very slowly. If you fill the same cup with water, the cup will drain more
quickly. That is because honey’s viscosity is much higher as compared to that of water. Hence,
viscosity determines the rate of flow of a liquid.

offered by different layers of a fluid to its flow is called viscosity.

91

--- PAGE 92 ---
UNITS FLUID MECHANICS

Gases also have viscosity, although it is a little harder to
notice it in ordinary circumstances. In
most liquids, viscosity decreases as temperature
increases, whereas in most gases, viscosity increases as
temperature increases. Therefore, it is important to
always measure the temperature of a fluid when
determining its viscosity. The coefficient of viscosity is
represented by 7. Its unit is N s m? or kg m's"' or Pas.
Substances that flow easily have small coefficient of

viscosity, while those that do not flow easily have large coefficient of viscosity. For example, .
water and air have low coefficient of viscosity, whereas honey and engine oil have large high

coefficient of viscosity.

Drag Force: A drag force acts on a solid
object when it is moving in a fluid (either a
gas or a liquid). You feel the drag force when
you move your hand through water. If you
stretch out your hand out of the window of a
fast-moving car, you can easily recognize
that considerable drag force has to be
exerted on your hand as it moves through the
air. You feel a smaller drag force when you
tilt your hand. The drag force become larger
as the speed of the car increases.

The retarding force (resistance) experienced —

by an object moving through a fluid is called ©

drag force or viscous drag. F;

When the fluid is a gas (like air), it is called
aerodynamic drag or air resistance. When the
fluid is a _ liquid (like water), it is
called hydrodynamic drag.

The drag force depends upon various factors
such as size, shape and orientation of the
object, viscosity of the fluid and the relative
speed of the object with respect to fluid.

their long migratory travels. This shape reduces
drag and energy consumption for individual birds.

and orientation of their Bodiektey bending, twisting
or stretching their arms and legs in and out. This
allows them to control their speed and direction of
motion by using the drag.

For small objects, the drag force is given by Stoke’s law. According to Stoke’s Law, the drag
force (Fg) on a spherical object is directly proportional to radius of object r, velocity v and
coefficient of viscosity 7 of fluid. sii the mathematical form of Stoke’s law is:

6.2.1 * Terminal i

Terminal Salat is attained when the weight of the object is balanced by the upward drag
force. For example, in case of a raindrop, initially, it accelerates due to the gravity (Fig. 6.4).
At first, there will be no drag force. As the velocity increases, the retarding force also increases.
As is object falls faster and faster, the drag force increases, So,

Net Force = weight - drag force | far At the begining | | |

Finally, when viscous drag is equal to the force due to | Alf resistance is

To land safely on ground, he opens his parachute, as shown in

6.3 FLUID FLOW

A fluid is a substance that can flow, such as a liquid or a gas. The flow rate of a fluid is the
volume of fluid passing a given point in a pipe per unit time. The fluid can flow in two ways:
streamline flow or turbulent flow.

Mf every particle ‘that. passing a particular point moves 5 take exactly the same smooth path
followed by previous’ particles that have passed that point earlier, then such flow is called
amline flow. 90 — pene ; Ree raner

Streamline flow, also known as ‘ial or laminar flow, is characterized by smooth flow of a
fluid through a tube, as shown in Fig. 6.6 (a). By smooth flow, we mean that all particles of the
fluid follow the same uniform path, called streamline. The streamlines (paths of different
particles) do not cross each other and every fluid particle arriving at a given point has the same
velocity. It usually occurs at lower velocities and with streamlined objects. In laminar flow, the
middle layer of fluid tends to flow faster.

Above a certain critical speed, streamline flow becomes turbulent. Turbulent flow is Pisigute flow
characterized by small whirlpool-like regions as shown in Fig. 6.6 (b). Turbulent flow, also known
as non-laminar flow, is the unpredictable flow of a fluid resulting from excessive speed ot the flow
or sudden changes in direction or size of the tube or pipe. Turbulent flow occurs at higher
yen or with non- arena Nee objects, where the flow lines become disordered and mixed.

a Irregular flow of fluid is called turbulent flow. Be eee CARS

As we have studied that the drag force depends on various factors such as size, shape and orientation
of the object. The drag force increases significantly with vehicle speed, which reduces the
performance of vehicles. Therefore, in Auto Engineering, the fast-moving objects are designed as
streamlined to improve their performance. A wind tunnel is used for studying the interaction between
a solid-stationary model and an airstream. A wind tunnel simulates this interaction by producing a
high-speed visible airstream (as shown in the picture) which flows across a model being tested.

6.4 EQUATION OF CONTINUITY

Equation of continuity is an important concept of fluid dynamics. Common applications where
equation of continuity is used are pipes, tubes, ducts with flowing fluids or gases, rivers and
power plants etc.

--- PAGE 97 ---
To derive this equation, consider the steady
flow of the fluid through a tube of varying
cross-sectional areas, as shown in the Fig. 6.7.
The tube has a single entry and single exit. In
short interval of time At, the fluid will cover a
distance Ax; with a velocity v; at the lower
end of the pipe. At this time, the distance
covered by the fluid will be:

Axi = Vv; At

Now, at the lower end of the pipe, the volume
of the fluid that will flow into the pipe will be:

V = Ay Axi = Ai v1 At

It is known that: mass (m) = Density (p) x Volume (V). So, the mass of the fluid in Ax; region
will be:

Am; =p*V
Am: = p1 Ar v; At (6.6)

Similarly, the mass of the fluid at the upper end in Ax2 region will be:
Am2 = P2A2 V2 At (6.7)

Here, v2 is the velocity of the fluid through the upper end of the
pipe i.e., through Ax, in At time and A: is the. cross-sectional
area of the upper end. As in case of ideal fluid flow, total mass of
fluid is conserved; so equating (6.6) and (6.7), we get:

Am; = Amo

P1 Ai Vi = P2 A2 V2 (6.8)

Moreover, if the fluid is incompressible, the density will remain
constant for steady flow, i.e., p1 = p2.

Thus, equation (6.8) can be written as:
Pats Aris Arve

Equation (6.9 a) is known as continuity equation and can be F sectional area decreases,

written ina more general form as: in accordance with the
Re TS 40) oe uation.

This equation states that for an ideal fluid, the. speeisce of cross-sectional area of the pipe and
the fluid speed at any point along the pipe is always constant (if there is no source or sink
present). This product is equal to the volume flow per second or simply the flow rate. From
equation of continuity, we can show that:

97

--- PAGE 98 ---
FLUID MECHANICS — 3 is

This relation shows that smaller the cross-sectional area, the greater the velocity of fluid, and
vice versa.

Application of Equation of Continuity: There are many phenomena in real word that make
use of the Equation of Continuity, as discussed below:

= WORD RE tee bn, UY

i) When the water falls freely, its speed increases and so its S si) 7
cross-sectional area decreases (as shown by the relation v « ens.

a, ). Hence this is in accordance with the continuity equation. ,
ii) By squeezing the end of a rubber pipe (as shown in Fig. 6.8 Lf ‘eS

b), its cross-sectional area (A) decreases. As a results velocity pms —

of water increases (as shown by the relation v « Py ). Hence Figure 6.8 (b): Squeezing the

end of a rubber pipe results in
according to the continuity equation, reducing the area of the Hohe in flow vain

opening will cause the velocity to increase.

Example 6.3: In a normal adult, the aver ge speed of the blood through the aorta (radius r =
0.8 cm) is 0.33 ms’. From the aort. blood goes into major arteries, which are 30 in
number, each of radius 0.4 cm. Calculate t the speed of the blood through the arteries.

Given: Radius of aorta = r; = 0.8 cm = 0.8 x 10? m
"Velocity of blood in aorta = v; = 0.33 ms’
Radius of artery = r2 = 0.4 cm = 0.4x10?7m >

To Find: Velocity of blood in arteries = v2 =? OQ.
Solution: We use equation of continuity at the aorta and arteries, such as:
Avy: = 30 Arv2 Y)

The factor of 30 on R.H.S appears because blood from aorta distributed into 30 equal-sized
arteries, each with an internal cross-sectional area A2. As A = mr* (internal ss ional area
being circular), thus above equation becomes: f

mrs vs = 30 nr v2

ri vi = 30 r? V2

Putting values, we get:

vis 2 eesn)’ 0.33

--- PAGE 99 ---
art | FLUID MECHANICS

V2 = 0.044 m s*

Thus, the blood flows through the arteries at a speed of 0.044 ms". This speed is much lower
than the speed of blood in aorta. This is due to the fact that the total combined internal cross-
sectional area of 30 arteries is greater than that of the aorta. The slower speed of the blood in
arteries is favorable for the exchange of gasses.

6.5 BERNOULLI’S EQUATION

The Bernoulli’s equation is an approximate relation between pressure, velocity and elevation
for flow of an ideal fluid. In this section, we will derive the Bernoulli’s equation by applying
the conservation of energy principle for flowing fluids.

Let us consider the two different regions, as shown in Fig. 6.9. An ideal fluid flows through the
pipe in time interval At. If the speed of fluid at lower point is v; and at upper point is v2, then
the distance Ax; covered by fluid in time At is v; At.

AX; = v; At (6.11)

Similarly, during the same interval of time At, the distance Ax; travelled by fluid is v2 At.

Ax2 = V2 At (6.12)
At lower end, the work done on the fluid in moving through a distance Ax;, will be:
Wi, = Fi Ax: (6.13)
using P = F/A or F = PA in (6.13), we get:
W; = Py As Ax; (6.14)
The work done on the fluid at the upper end is negative because Fz is opposite to F;. Thus:
W2 = -P2 A2 Ax2 (6.15)

Net work done W is obtained by adding equation (6.14) and equation (6.15), i.e.

Thus, Bernoulli’s equation states that sum of the pressure, the potential energy per unit volume
and the kinetic energy per unit volume will remain constant. Bernoulli’s equation is an
important tool in investigating many technical systems such as power generation stations,
plumbing systems and flight of an aeroplane.

6.6 APPLICATIONS OF BERNOULLI’S EQUATION

According to Bernoulli’s equation, slow air flow creates a high pressure while fast air flow
creates low pressure. This effect is used in many fields of life, such as in filter pump, venturi
meter, atomizers, the flow of air over an aerofoil and in blood flow. In this section, we will

| prediction by doing this activity. Was your prediction correct? —

| The sheets will move closer to one another. This is due to the

Bernoulli’s principle, which states that fast airflow creates low

_ pressure between the two sheets. Thus, sheets will move towards

_ the low-pressure central region. (

6.6.1 Atomizer

Atomizer is a device that is used to emit liquid droplets as fine spray. It
works on Bernoulli's principle.

When you squeeze the rubber bulb (Fig. 6.10), high speed air passes
horizontally over a vertical tube and creating a lower pressure than that
inside the container. This pressure difference pushes the liquid from
the reservoir up through the vertical narrow tube and into the moving
stream of air. Atomizer has a nozzle at the end of the horizontal tube,
which causes the liquid to break up into small drops, mixing it with the
air and carried away with the stream of air.

Atomizer nozzles are used for spraying perfumes, applying paint and
in engine carburetor etc.

6.6.2 Filter Pump

A filter pump is designed and can be explained on the basis of
Bernoulli’s effect. A filter pump has a jet in the middle (Fig. 6.11).
When water from tap reaches the jet, its speed increases and hence
causes a pressure drop near it. According to Bernoulli’s Principle, the
pressure of the moving air decreases as the speed of the air increases.

The air thus flows in from the side tube to which the vessel is connected. The air and water
together are forced to the bottom of the filter pump.

object falls freely from height h, its initial velocity vy, = 0 and its final velocity after falling
height h is v; = v, then using third equation of motion, we get:

Putting values, we have:

This is the same result as in equation (6.24), indicating that the speed of flow of fluid from an
orifice at depth h below the top surface of a liquid is equal to the speed gained by the fluid in

6.6.4 Venturi Meter
A venturi meter (or flow meter) is used to measure the flow speed of liquid through a tube.
The liquid having high pressure and low velocity gets converted to the low pressure and high
velocity at a particular point and again reaches to high pressure and low velocity. The point
where the fluid has low pressure and high velocity is the place where the venturi flow meter is
used.

Figure 6.13: Venturi meter.

The venturi meter is constructed, as shown in Fig. 6.13. Venturi meter is so designed as to
ensure the stream line flow of liquid through a pipe section with area Ai, a flow velocity v; and
pressure P;. In the narrow section (the throat) with area Az, the fluid flows with flow speed v2,
and has pressure P2. As a result, the pressure difference at two points 1 and 2 is appeared as a
height difference h.

To derive an expression for the pressure difference, we use the Bernoulli’s equation and the
continuity equation. First applying Bernoulli’s equation to the portion 1 and 2, we have:

Py + ; p V? + pgh; = P2 + ; p V3 + pghz

In the case of a ball spinning through the air, the

spinning ball drags some of the surrounding air with it. A spinning object moving through a fluid
deviates from its straight path because of pressure differences that develop in the fluid as a

result of velocity changes induced by the spinning body.

Example 6.4: Water is flowing streamline through a closed pipe system. The speed of water
at one point is 4 ms" and the pressure is 47,1 kPa, while at another point 3 m lower, the

speed is 3 ms‘. Find the pressure at the lower point.
Given: At higher point:

Speed =v; =4ms" height = hi= 3.0 m

Pressure = P; = 47.1 kPa = 47.110 Pa
At lower point:

Speed = v2=3ms" height = hz = 0m

To Find: Pressure = P,=?
Solution: Apply Bernoulli’s theorem:

Pi+ 2 pVi+ pghi= Pr + ~ p V3 + pgh

By rearranging above equation, we get:
P, =P; + + p(s — V3) +pg(h - ha)

Putting the given values, and taking p = 1000 kg/m’ for water, we get:
P2 = (47.110) + : (1000) [(4)?~(3)"] + (1000)(9.8)(3 -0)

After using calculator, we get:
P2 = 47.1 +3.5+29.4x 10°
P2 = 80,000 Pa or 80 k Pa

6.7 SUPER FLUIDITY

Super fluidity is astate in which a liquid experiences ° —
zero viscosity, hence flows without friction through any *
surface. As a result, these fluids therefore flow without any :

loss of kinetic energy. When stirred, superfluid forms ~
vortices that continue to spin indefinitely. This allows for +
super fluids to creep over the walls of containers to ‘empty’ 2

themselves, as shown in Fig. 6.16.

, ~~ ;

a

Super fluidity is observed in liquid helium at temperatures Figure 6.16: Super fluids creeps
near absolute zero, as well. as electrons within a over the walls of containers to

superconducting solid. The neutron fluid in a neutron star

may also be a superfluid. The unusual behavior of superfluid arises from quantum mechanical

effects.
To create superfluid states, helium gas [4
cooled to a few degrees above absolute
zero, as shown by the graph in Fig. 6.17. <=
This is achieved by compressing the gas, ¢
and then expelling it through a small 2
nozzle. As the gas expands, it rapidly i
cools.

If a superfluid is placed in a rotating
container, instead of rotating uniformly 0
with the container, the rotating state
consists of quantized vortices. That is,
when the container is rotated below a

The vortex strength of super fluid is quantized, i.e.,
a superfluid can only spin at certain ‘allowed’
angular velocities. Rotation in a normal fluid (like
water) is not quantized. If the rotation speed is
increased more and more quantized vortices will be
formed which arrange in wonderful patterns.

certain velocity (known as the critical angular velocity), the liquid remains perfectly stationary.
Once the critical angular velocity is achieved, the superfluid will form a vortex.

For Your Information

Helium-4 (He) becomes a superfluid at a
temperature below 2.17 K. Helium-3
(He) becomes a superfluid below
0.0025 K.

Application of Superfluids: Superfluids are used in high-precision devices, such as
gyroscopes, which allow the measurement of some theoretically predicted gravitational
effects. Recently, superfluids have been used to trap and slow the speed of light.

Fluid Mechanics and Medical Technology
Medical technology uses heartbeat and sound of blood flow to find the blood pressure. A fluid exerts
pressure on the walls of its container. As a fluid, blood also exerts pressure on the walls of the heart,
arteries, vessels, and capillaries that make up the circulatory system. The sphygmomanometer is a well-
known medical equipment used for the measurement of blood pressure of a person. The
sphygmomanometer cuff (air bag) is placed around the upper arm of a person, inflated, and then deflated
while the meter measures the pressure of blood passing through those arteries in the arm. The external
pressure is increased by pressing the air bulb repeatedly. The sound of the blood flow is heard by the
stethoscope.
The gradual increase in pressure squeezes the arm and compresses
the blood vessels under the air bag. When the pressure in the air bag
becomes greater than the systolic pressure (120 torr), then the
vessels collapse, cutting off the flow of blood. At this instant _
stethoscope detect no sound. The pressure in the bag is then
decreased by slowly opening the release valve of air bulb. When the
external pressure becomes equal to systolic pressure, the blood
flows (turbulent) with high speed through narrow contracted vessel.
Stethoscope detects sound at this instant and dial of the barometer
gives systolic pressure. By further opening the release valve, the pressure in the air bag drops enough
that the vessels no longer remain compressed and the blood is now in laminar flow. At this instant there
are no gurgle’s sound heard by stethoscope, so this is the signal to record diastolic pressure.
For a normal person the blood pressure varies between systolic (120 torr) to diastolic (75-80 torr). These
values change with age.

SUMMARY "On

@ Archimedes principle states that: When an object is totally or partially immersed in a
liquid, an up-thrust acts on it equal to the weight of the liquid it displaces.

© The resistance offered by different layers of a fluid to its flow is called viscosity. Its unit is
Ns m* or kg m's‘ or Pas.

* The retarding force (resistance) experienced by an object moving through a fluid is called
drag force or viscous drag.

< The maximum constant velocity acquired by a freely falling object in a viscous medium is
called terminal velocity.

If every particle that passes a particular point moves along exactly the same smooth path

followed by previous particle passing that has passed that point, then such flow is called
Streamline.

* Irregular flow of fluid is called turbulent flow.

* Equation of continuity is defined as: For an ideal fluid the product of cross-sectional area
of the pipe and the fluid speed at any point along the pipe is always constant. This product
is equal to the volume flow per second or simply the flow rate.

* Bernoulli’s equation states that sum of the pressure, the potential energy per unit volume
and the kinetic energy per unit volume will remain constant. According to Bernoulli’s
equation slow air flow creates a high pressure, while fast air flow creates low pressure.

107

--- PAGE 108 ---
FLUID MECHANICS

+ The speed of flow of fluid from an orifice at depth h below the top surface of a liquid is
equal to speed gained by the fluid in free falling through the height h. This statement is
called Torricelli’s Theorem.

* A venturi meter (or flow meter) is used to measure the flow rate of liquid through a tube.

* An aerofoil is the term used to describe the cross-sectional shape of an object that creates
a lift, when moved through a fluid such as air.

*% In Magnus effect, a spinning ball curves away from its path of flight.

* Super fluidity is a state in which a liquid experiences zero viscosity, hence flows without
friction past any surface.

Materials have specific uses depending upon their properties and characteristics, such as
hardness, ductility, brittleness, malleability and response to the applied pressure. What makes
steel hard and lead soft? It depends on the structure, the particular order and the bonding of
atoms in a material. This clue has made it possible to design and create materials with unique
properties for their use in the modern technology.

7.1 CLASSIFICATION OF SOLIDS

Solids are the materials which are incompressible and have a fixed shape and volume. On the

basis of atomic arrangement (the structure), solids may be classified into three types:
crystalline, polycrystalline (polymeric) and amorphous (glassy) solids.

7.1.1 Crystalline Solids

In solids, particles are closely packed
together but their packing may have s ga”
different patterns. The arrangement ¥

of particles can be studied by X-rays A, A re

Crystalline solids are those in nts A ry th

defined arrangement. “Figure 7.1: The molecular (left) and ionic (right) crystal

crystals are shown in Fig. 7.1.

Examples of crystalline solids include salts (sodium chloride, and potassium chloride), metals
(copper, iron and zinc), non-metals (diamond, sulphar and mica), ionic compounds (NaCl and
copper sulphate), ceramic (zirconium), sand and quartz. Crystalline solids have sharp melting
points. Crystalline solids are anisotropic for their physical property measurement. On cutting,
they give sharp cleaves.

7.1.2 Polycrystalline Solids

The solids having structure in between order and disorder, are called
polycrystalline or polymeric solids. Hence, these are partially or
poorly crystalline.

A solid material made up of many small crystals with random a
orientation, is called polycrystalline solid.

The small crystals in polymeric solids are known as crystallites or Figure 7.2:

grains which are oriented in different directions, and have distinct Polycrystalline

grain boundaries, as shown in Fig. 7.2. Normally, grains of the ain
polycrystalline solids have sizes in the range of 10? nm to 10? nm. Polycrystalline materials are
isotropic and exhibit the same properties in all directions.

make large chains of molecules by a process called

Amorphous solids do not have a regular structure. The term
‘amorphous’ means without regular form or structure.

Solid materials whose constituent particles are arranged) in a
random manner are called amorphous solids.

Amorphous solids, also called glassy solids, have structure like
frozen liquids. They have fix volume but not definite regular
geometrical shape, as shown in Fig. 7.3 (the structure of
beryllium fluoride (BeF2)). Latest technique called ‘atomic
electron tomography’, a type of 3-D imaging showed 85 % of
atoms were in a disorder arrangement in amorphous solids but
there were pockets, where a fraction of atoms found into ordered
super-clusters, hence, they are called short range ordered
materials. They have a range of melting temperature, i.e., if we
heat a glass rod, it gradually softens into a paste like state before
it becomes viscous liquid at 800 °C.

manufacturing of tyres and production of shoes.

converting sunlight into electricity, used in solar
panels.

7.1.4 Unit Cell and Crystal Lattice

The crystal structure of solid is analyzed by using X-
ray diffraction and Bragg’s law. Solids are
characterized by their structure, which is made up of
some basic unit, that can be defined as:
A unit cell is the smallest basic portion of a crystal,
which repeatedly stacked. together in three
dimensions, to make the entire crystal structure.
A unit cell has all the characteristics of the whole
crystal. The atoms, molecules or ions which make
the crystal, are called basis and are arranged in
regular pattern. An imaginary geometrical structure
to join the basis is called lattice. A lattice basically
tells us about the basic structure of the points
(basis). The crystal structure is obtained by |.
placement of atoms on basis.

The structure of a crystal, obtained by the
repetition of the unit cell, is known as crystal
lattice.

A unit cell and its corresponding crystal lattice
are shown in Fig. 7.5 (a). There are three types

7.2 DEFORMATION IN SOLIDS

A solid has definite shape and volume, possesses rigidity, is not compressed easily, has closely
packed particles and cannot flow. In order to change the shape or size of a solid, a force is
required. For example, if you stretch a spring by pulling its ends, the length of the spring
increases. When you release the ends of the spring, it regains its original shape and size. To
study the mechanical properties of solids, we usually check the behavior of solids under applied
force. Application of force on a solid may bring change in its dimension, i.e., it deforms a solid.

The change in shape, length: or
volume of a solid when it is
subjected to an external force is |
called deformation.

For example, if we squeeze a
rubber ball with our fingers, we can
observe the deformation that ~
occur. Similarly, at atomic level, a

7.7. The results of mechanical tests are usually expressed in terms of stress and strain, which
can be defined in terms of applied force and resulting deformation.

Auto Engineering and Technoloe
What makes the moving parts of engine frictionless? Due to very low coefficient
of friction and shine, Teflon (an amorphous solid) is used for coating the
materials used in automobiles, industries and manufacturing. Teflon coating is
used in high efficiency engines to reduce the friction, as it has good efficiency
even at higher temperatures. It is also used in nonstick cooking utensils and
moving parts of machines.

7.2.1 Stress and Strain

The internal resistance offered by a body to resist deformation is called stress. It is a physical
quantity that measures the magnitude of force causing the deformation. Stress is directly
proportional to the applied force and inversely proportional to the area of cross section over
which the force applied. It can be defined as:

The applied force per unit area is called stress.

The SI unit of stress is newton per square meter

(N m), also known as pascal (Pa) and its vias Rail ia

dimensions are [ML"'T?]. Generally, stress can Figure 7.8: There are five OF SFOS,

called ‘elasticity’. For elastic solids, the ratio of the stress
to the strain is always a constant and is called ‘elastic
modulus’. Mathematically, it can be given as:

Ww

Elastic modulus = sae
Since strain has no units, hence mochilus of elasticity has the
same units as that of the stress i.e. N m® (or Pa) and
dimensions as [ML"T?]. Depending upon type of stress,
modulus of elasticity is of three types, as under:

Young’s Modulus: In case of linear deformation, the ratio
of the tensile stress to the tensile strain is called “Young’s
modulus’, and is represented by ‘Y’. Mathematically it can
be given as:

Here, ‘F’ is the aéeciial ies on area ‘A of the silat. (ay
a rod) of length ‘L’. The force changes the length by ‘AL’, r

Bulk Modulus: For three dimensional forces, the deformation
occurs in all directions, as shown in Fig. 7.10. In this case, the

Here, the ein sign shows the Jjacveun' in volume, but bulk

Shear Modulus: Due to tangential force, the deformation is
produced in the shape of a body, as shown in Fig. 7.11. In this
case, the ratio of the shear stress to the shear strain is called
‘shear modulus’. Mathematically, it is expressed as:

, Here, strain is the ratio of the displacement of the sheared face
to the height of fix face. With reference to the triangle, shown in Fig. 7.11, the shear strain it
is expressed as:

of 2700 kg m®. Find the compressive stress at the cross-section located 3.0 m below the
top of the pillar and value of compressive strain of the a m cel avec of the pillar.

Discussion: The normal force acting on the cross-sectional area is not constant along its length,
but varies from the smallest value at the top to the largest value at the bottom of the pillar.
So if the pillar has constant area of cross section along its lenth, the stress is the largest at the
bottom. That is why the base portion of pillar has gradual increase in cross section, as can be
seen from given figure.

7.2.3 Stress-Strain Curve

To study the behavior of a material
under applied stress, we use a tensile
test machine which strains the material
at a fixed linear rate and records the
stress. The values are then plotted on a
graph by a computer attached to the
machine. Strain is plotted along
horizontal axis and stress on the
vertical axis. A typical stress-strain
graph for a ductile material is shown in
Fig. 7.12. In the initial stage of
deformation, the stress increases
linearly with the strain, as shown by the
portion (OA) in the graph. This portion
has linear proportionality between Permanent set < 1%

stress and strain and obeys Hooke’s law. Figure 7.12: Stress-strain curve for a ductile material

but still if stress is removed, the body will regain its original

called ‘plasticity’, where if the stress is zero still strain is not zero. This region is represented
by the portion after point ‘B’ and onward. Stress is increased further at point ‘D’, called
ultimate tensile strength (6, ), the maximum stress that a material can withstand. After crossing

point ‘D’ the body breaks at point ‘E’ representing the fracture stress (0 ', )» Substances, which

undergo plastic deformation until they break are known as ductile materials. Lead, copper and
wrought iron are examples of ductile materials. Other materials, which break just after elastic
limit are called brittle materials, like glass and high carbon steel.

To Find: Change in length ‘AL’ =?
Solution: The force is equal to the weight supported by the bone:

The area of the cross-section is:

Discussion: This change in length is very small, consistent with our experience that bones are
rigid. Even the large forces during haevy physical activities (like weight lifting) of a person do
not compress or bend bones significantly.

7.3 ELASTIC POTENTIAL ENERGY

As works done on bodies store some amount of energy in them, similarly work done on elastic
bodies for deformation also stores energy in the body which is known as elastic potential
energy.

To study the work done on a body to produce strain, consider a ,
metallic wire which can be strained by the application of force on it.
Measure the length and area of cross section of the wire and connect —
a vernier scale to it. Take another wire as reference wire with a scale
on it for precise measurement of change in length of the metallic wire
upon adding the load (weight) with it, as shown in Fig. 7.13. We will
find the extension in the wire with the help of vernier scale due to the

From equations (7:5 a) and (7.5 b), it is clear that the work done during the application of a

7.3.3 Derivation of Elastic Potential Energy

The energy stored in a material due to strain produced in it is called the elastic potential
energy. This energy can be calculated by using the relation for work done during extension. For
an elastic material, the force can be given by the Hook’s law as:

SUMMARY

Solids can be classified into crystalline, polycrystalline and amorphous.

“ Crystalline solids have a regular three dimensional structure. Polycrystalline solids have a
structure that is intermediate between order and disorder, while amorphous solids have an
irregular structure.

* A unit cell is the basic building block of the crystalline solids whose repetition in all
directions makes a whole crystal.

* Stress is the force applied on unit area of a solid and the deformation produces due to it is
called strain.

% The modulus of elasticity of a solid is a constant, and is the ratio of stress to strain.

“ Tensile stress produces a change in length and the ratio of this change in length to the
original length is called tensile strain. The ratio of the tensile stress to the tensile strain is
called Young’s modulus.

* Volume stress produces a change in volume of a solid and the ratio of this change in volume
to original volume is called the volume strain. The ratio of the volume stress to the volume
strain is called bulk modulus.

“ Shear stress produces change in shape and the ratio of the sheared face to the fix face is
called shear strain. The ratio of the shear stress to the shear strain is called shear modulus.

* Strain energy of a material is represented by the area under the stress-strain curve.

& Elastic materials break shortly after elastic limit, while those who break after ultimate
tensile strength, are called plastic materials.

ties) HEAT AND THERMODYNAMICS

The concept of temperature is rooted in qualitative ideas of “hot” and “cold” based on our
sense of touch. A body that feels hot usually has a higher temperature than a similar body that
feels cold. However, many properties of matter that we can measure depend on temperature.
The length of a metal rod, steam pressure in a boiler, the ability of a wire to conduct an electric
current, and the color of a very hot glowing object—all these depend on temperature.
Temperature is also related to the kinetic energies of the molecules of a material.

Heat is the form of energy associated with the kinetic energies of all the molecules in a
substance and its unit is joule. Temperature describes the degree of hotness and coldness of
an object and it is the measure of average kinetic energy of the molecules and its unit is kelvin.

8.1 THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM

Two systems are in thermal equilibrium with
each other, if they are at the same
temperature.

The temperature is the main property that
determines whether two systems will be in
thermal equilibrium or not. When two

bodies at different temperatures are THERMAL ENERGY INEAT) iS APTEN EOME Tike, BOTH MEGIONS

thermal equilibrium. Thus, we can state y
that when two bodies are in thermal equilibrium (at same temperature), no net heat flow takes
place between them. A system is said to be in thermal equilibrium with the surroundings, if
each part of the system and the surrounding are at the same temperature.

For Your Information
System: The matter or space region that is being studied is
cylinder, etc.
Surroundings of the system: The term “surroundings” refers to everything outside the system.
Boundary of the system: A system is separated from the surroundings by its boundary. All energy
changes, caused by the work done or heat exchange between the system and its surroundings, take place
through this boundary.
Types of the systems:
Closed system: It is a system in which heat energy can enter or leave the system but mass cannot do
either. An example of a closed system is a container sealed on all sides.
Open system: A system in which both heat energy and mass can enter or leave it, is called open system.
An example of open system is a glass beaker with an open top which allows matter (i.e., water) to be
added or removed, as well as, heat to be added or removed.
Isolated system: A system in which there is no transfer of mass and heat energy across its boundary is
called an isolated system. An example of it is a thermos flask filled with hot water.

8.1.1 Internal Energy

The sum of all the forms of molecular energies (such as kinetic and potential energy) of a
substance is called internal energy. An ideal gas is one in which all collisions between atoms or
molecules are perfectly elastic and there are no intermolecular attractive forces between
them. The internal energy of an ideal gas system is generally the translational K.E of its
molecules. Molecules of a gas are always in random motion. According to the kinetic theory of
gases, the average kinetic energy of gas molecules is given by:

Where k is Boltzmann’s constant. If temperature increases,
the average kinetic energy of gas molecules also increases. |
Therefore, the internal energy increases with rise in |
temperature.

Since temperature is directly proportional to average kinetic energy of gas molecules, i.e.

Tx<K.E>. Therefore, the internal energy of an ideal gas is directly proportional to its
temperature.

The internal Energy of a system can be increased by heating and doing mechanical work. When
we heat a substance, energy associated with its atoms or molecules increases. i.e., heat is
converted into internal energy. Similarly, when two objects are rubbed together, their internal
energy increases due to the mechanical work. The increase in temperature of the object
indicates an increase in its internal energy. Likewise, when an object slides over a surface and
comes to rest due to frictional forces, the mechanical work done on or by the system is partially
converted into internal energy. In study of heat changes and heat flow, we focus on the changes

in the internal energy of a substance with changes in temperature indicating these changes in
internal energy. -

St ger
4,

In thermodynamics, internal energy is function of state.
Consequently, it does not depend on the path but depends on
initial and final states of the system.

Consider a system which undergoes a pressure and volume
change from P, and V,to P, and V2, regardless of the process
by which the system changes from initial to final state, as
shown in the Fig. 8.1 (b). The change in internal energy is the
same and is independent of the paths C, and C, and it depends
on the temperature difference between two points. Like the
gravitational P.E we take the change in internal energy and not
its absolute value, which is important.

In case of real gases, the molecules exert mutual force of
attraction on one another. The internal energy of real gas is

129

--- PAGE 130 ---
a

HEAT AND THERMODYNAMICS

partially kinetic energy and partially intermolecular potential energy and hence it is function
of temperature and volume.

Sign Conventions: If initial internal energy is U, at initial temperature T, and final internal
energy U, at final temperature T,, then change in internal energy = AU = U2 — U,.

* When the temperature of a system increases then its internal energy incréases (U2 > U; )
and the change in internal energy AU is positive.

e When the temperature of a system decreases then its internal energy decreases (Uz < U; )
and the change in internal energy AU is negative.

e When the temperature of a system remains constant then its internal energy remains
constant (i.e., Uz = U, ) and the change in internal energy AU is zero.

8.2 KINETIC THEORY OF GASES

In the 19" century, James Clark Maxwell, Rudolph,
Clausius and others developed the kinetic theory of
gases to explain the behaviour of gases. According to
the theory, a gas is composed of a number of tiny, hard
spheres (molecules) that collide with one another and
with the container walls. These molecules move in
accordance with Newton's laws of motion. It explains
how the motion of molecules influences the
macroscopic properties of gases, such as temperature
and pressure. It relates macroscopic properties (T, P, | “O/=Slis
and V etc.) of gases to microscopic properties (K.E etc.).

Assumptions of Kinetic Theory of Gases: The following are the assumptions of the kinetic
theory of gases:

¢ A finite volume of gas consists of a very large number of molecules.

e The size of the molecules is much smaller-than the separation between them.

e The gas molecules are in random motion and may change their direction of motion after
every collision. Collisions between gas molecules and with the walls of the container are
assumed to be perfectly elastic.

e Molecules exert no force on each other except during a collision.

For given mass of the gas, we e-can write above equation a as: px—

This equation suggests that at low pressure and high temperature, the density of gas will be
low. Moreover, the distance between gas molecules becomes large, leading to the negligible
intermolecular forces. In this situation, a real gas behaves as an ideal gas. Conversely, at high
pressure and low temperature, the density of gas will be high while the distance between gas
molecules will be small and intermolecular forces will be stronger; therefore, a real gas cannot
behave as an ideal gas.

8.2.1 Work in Thermodynamics

Bahasa Meet aay peop} ies ney
Both heat and work correspond to the transfer of energy by some means. One of the main ways,
energy enters or leaves’a system is through work. To calculate the work done by a constant
force, we can use the following general equation:

Work = Force x Displacement

We are primarily concerned with the work that gases do when
they expand or contract in thermodynamics.

Pressure-Volume Work: Let us consider a gas that is
contained in a cylinder with a movable, frictionless piston with —
a Cross-sectional area A, as shown in the Fig. 8.3, When the |
system is in equilibrium, it occupies a volume “V" and exerts
pressure “P" on the cylinder’s walls and the piston, i.e.,

P=F/A Or F=PA | :
This is the force exerted by the gas on the piston. The gas Figure 8.3: Work done by

A sample of gas is compressed to one third of its initial volume at constant pressure of
2.25 x 10° Nm”. During the compression, 200 J of work is done on the gas. Determine the
final volume of the gas.

8.2.2 Difference between Work Done by the Gas and on the Gas

In nai work k done is given by:

Positive Work Done: When gas expands, it is
said that work is done by the gas (system) on the |
surroundings. Due to the expansion of gas, the
final volume will be greater than the initial
volume. So, the change in volume of the gas is
positive, i.e., AV > 0, as shown in the Fig. 8.5.
Therefore,. the work done by the gas on the
ell is positive. Leweanisecesoen i
Therefore, aa a a gas as expands, we can say that
the work done by the system on the surroundings is positive.
Negative Work Done: When gas contracts,
the final volume of the gas is smaller than the
initial volume. So, the change in volume of
the gas is negative, i.e. AV < 0, as shown in
the Fig. 8.6. Therefore, the work done on the
gas by the surroundings is negative.
saathennanically,

Zero Work Done: If volume remains constant, then change in volume is zero (i.e., AV = 0),
and the work done is zero.

It is a common observation that whenever we change the external conditions like temperature
and pressure, the volume of a given quantity of any gas is affected. Gas laws provide the
relationships between the volume of given amount of a gas and variables like canieieial or
pressure.

8.3.2 Charles’s Law

If pressure of a given amount of gas is kept constant,
there is a relation between volume of the gas and its

Graphically, it is shown in Fig. 8.8. This graph also indicates that at temperature -273 °C the
volume of all gases reduces to zero showing that a gas cannot exist at such a low temperature.

8.3.3 Gay Lussac’s Law

To find the relation between pressure and
temperature of given amount of a gas at constant |
volume, we refer Amontons’s law, also called as Gay
Lussac’s law, which can be stated as:

Kelvin scale.

8.4 FIRST LAW OF THERMOD

Whenever heat is added to a system, the internal energy of the system increases due to the
rise in temperature of the system. At the same time, if the system is allowed to expand, it may
do work on its environment. First law of thermodynamics is based on law of conservation of
energy — on thermodynamic process. The first law of thermodynamics can be stated as:

Similarly, when heat is removed from the system, its aan energy —
decreases and the work will be done on the system due to ©
compression in a gas (system).

The change in internal energy AU = U; - U; of the system depends
only on the initial and the final states of the system; it is |
independent of the path followed. It is the change in internal energy _
which is important, that is why we use change in internal energy in —
spite of absolute value of internal energy.

Examples: First law of thermodynamics dictates the behavior of heat energy:

¢ Melting of ice cubes is an example of first law of thermodynamics.

¢ Sweating in a crowded room is also an example of first law of thermodynamics, in which
heat from a person’s body transfers to sweat, which take away heat of the body but warms
the room by increasing the temperature of atmosphere in the room.

e Filling the air in the tube of a car wheel is also an example of first law of thermodynamics,
in which mechanical work of pumping the gas increases internal energy of system.

e Human metabolism is also an example of first law of thermodynamics, when we do work
our internal energy decreases and body temperature falls. To maintain internal energy, we
require food which provides energy to our bodies.

There are some applications of first law of thermodynamics, which are even below.

8.4.1 Isothermal Process

“A thermodynamic process in which temperature
remains constant throughout the process is called

This process is a condition for the application of
Boyle’s law, where the product of pressure and
volume remains constant. For understanding the
process, consider an ideal gas, as shown in. Fig.
8.10. Initially at pressure P; and volume V;. After
heating the system, the moveable piston moves
outward by increasing the volume to V2 and
decreasing the pressure to P;, while temperature of
gas remains constant. Hence, such that product of
pressure and volume will remain same for both
initial and final values. In this example, as the gas
expands, work is done by the gas, if gas compresses
the work will be done on the gas. Furthermore, the

internal energy of the system remains constant, |
i.e., AU = 0, due to constant temperature. Hence, for isothermal

isothermal process.

e Changing states of different liquids through the process of

e Reaction in a heat pump is also an example of isothermal
process.

8.4.2 Adiabatic Process

lf we do not supply or remove heat from the

system, can the system still perform work? |
Yes, when a system expands without addition
of heat, it still does work.

A process in which no heat or mass transfer
between a thermodynamic system pe

surroundings is called an adiabatic process. 44

In adiabatic process, the system. transfers |
energy only to the surroundings as work. |
Hence, for adiabatic process, the first law of |
ee is written as:

This equation dices that if no heat is seed
to the system and system still expands and |

perform work, this work is done at the expense _
of internal energy.

In adiabatic process, if gas expands and does

work, its temperature and internal energy decreases.

temperature and internal energy increases. In an

8.4.3 lsochoric Process
When you heat a gas in closed container, what will happen? There are some thermodynamic
processes in which system does not change its volume; such a process is called isochoric process.

“A thermodynamic process in which volume of the system remains constant is called is¢
or constant-volume process. “ig ae

For example, consider a gas enclosed in a
thermally conducting but fixed container.
When this gas is heated, its pressure
increases from P; to Pz, and temperature
increases from T; to Tz, leading to the
increase in its internal energy, as shown in
Fig. 8.12. As we know that work done is the
product of pressure and change in volume —
i.e., W = P AV. In this case, as volume is
constant (i.e., AV = 0), this implies that

aS Wa0 a
Hence, the first law of thermodynamics
reduces to the form:

This means that in isochoric process, all the

heat given to the system will be utilized in increasing its internal energy. On the other hand, if
heat is removed from the system in isochoric process, both temperature and pressure of the
system decrease. The P-V graph of isochoric process is a vertical line and called “isochor”.
Examples of isochoric process include:

e Cooking food in a pressure cooker: a closed container where when heat is supplied the

temperature and pressure get increased.
e When-gasoline-air mixture is burnt in the engine of a car, it increases the pressure and
temperature of the gas but volume of a gas remains constant.

When a gas expands slowly due to heat being supplied while keeping the
pressure constant, it is an example of isobaric process.

Let’s consider a gas in the container with a cross-sectional area A, as
shown in Fig. 8.13, with initial pressure, temperature and volume P, T;

8. 5 HEAT ENGINE }

As we know that. heat wid energy are two distinct quantities but are closely related; heat can
be converted into work and vice versa.

A heat engine is a device that converts heat energy into mechanical work.

Petrol engine and steam engine are examples of heat engine. The earliest heat engine was a
steam engine. Every heat engine must have three parts, namely a hot reservoir, a cold reservoir
and a working substance. The working principle of a
heat engine is the second law of thermodynamics in
which we can extract the useful work during the heat
transfer from a hotter body to a colder one.

Hot Reservoir: For a heat engine to function, a hot

reservoir (or heat source) is necessary. This is the source F Ww ™
of heat, which is to be converted into useful work. For the . Engine
operation of a heat engine, its temperature must be m

maintained at higher level, denoted by ‘T;’ as shown in | “1Q)

Fig. 8.14. This reservoir supplies a quantity of heat ‘Q,’ — . —-—~

flowing towards low temperature.

Cold Reservoir: For a heat engine, a cold reservoir (or Cot Reservoir Th

heat sink) is another necessary part. The difference Figure 8. 1 4: Heat enaine.
between the temperatures of both reservoirs is

responsible for the heat flow. Heat sink absorbs heat ‘Q,’ at temperature ‘T2’ from heat source.
Cold reservoir is essential for the 0 i of heat engine, as heat can only flow when there
is a difference.

Working Substance: In a heat engine, a working substance is the main part which practically
converts heat into useful mechanical work. Working substance in most of the heat engines is a

Thermodynamics and Auto-engine

A petrol engine of a car extracts heat from burning fuel and converts some of its energy into
work, The engine expels rest of energy to the atmosphere. A petrol engine roughly has efficiency of
about 25% to 30%. Motorbikes normally has two cylinders whereas cars have four cylinders on the same
crankshaft timed to fire turn by turn in succession for smooth running of car. It has four. steps of working.
Intake Stroke: In this stroke, the piston moves downward and petrol-air mixture is drawn through inlet
valve, as shown in figure (a).
Compression Stroke: In this stroke, piston moves upward, inlet valve closed and petrol-air mixture
compresses adiabatically, as shown in figure (b).
Power Stroke: A spark ignites the
mixture, causing a rapid increase in
temperature and pressure, expands
adiabatically, and hence forces the
piston to move downwards. This is the
stroke which delivers the power to the
engine and hence called power stroke,
as shown in figure (c).
Exhaust Stroke: in this stroke piston
moves upward. Outlet valve opens and
residual gases are expelled out into the intake
atmosphere as shown in figure (d). (a)

8.6 REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE-PROCESSES

In thermodynamics, a process occurs, when exchange of energy takes place between the system
and its surroundings. There are mainly two types of processes in thermodynamics: reversible
and irreversible processes.

. bap } Thermodynamics and
eversible Process: Thermometry

A process which can be retraced in exactly reverse order without
causing any change to its surroundings is called reversible process.

For example, if heat is absorbed.in a direct process, it will be
evolved in the reverse process. If work is done by the system in
direct process, it will be done on the system in reverse process.
In reality, no actual change is exactly reversible but some changes .

A succession of events which bring the system back to its initial’
condition is called cyclic process. ni et

For example, an event ‘A’ brings the system from condition 4 to
condition ‘2’, as shown in Fig. 8.15. Then another event B brings |
back the system from condition ‘2’ to condition ‘1’, is a cyclic
process.

Heat engines are normally operated in cycles. Ina reversible cycle, |
all the changes are reversible, but it is an idealization. We can take "Figure 8.15: A Sa
some real processes close to the reversible process by ignoring the niet

minute changes.

8.7 SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

The first law of thermodynamics deals with the conversion of heat into work and vice versa; it
is simply law of conservation of energy. However, it does not address the conditions under
which this conversion takes place. For finding this condition, we require another law, the
second law of thermodynamics. This law deals with the circumstances under which heat can be
converted into work and also the direction heat flow. It can be stated in two different ways as:

Lord Kelvin’s Statement:
DO ai lt ? |

en eee |

It is impossible for a heat engine to convert heat taken from ° ibeaadiag
single reservoir entirely into work without leaving any change | | process?
in the working system. i - j

It is clear that in any heat engine, a single heat reservoir, no matter how much energy it
contains, cannot be made to perform any work. This is why heat content of our atmosphere
cannot be utilized for work, as it is a single source and there is no sink relative to it.

Rudolf Clausius’s Statement:

It is impossible to cause heat to flow from cold body to hot body without the expend
work.

Second law of thermodyriemies explains that both a hot and a cold raminvole are essential for a
working substance to do work. As from Fig. 8.14, a heat source Q; rejects heat towards a heat

142

--- PAGE 143 ---
sink Q at lower temperature, while
some of the heat is converted into
mechanical work W, which can be
given as:

In a cyclic process, the substance
eventually returns to its initial state,
so the change in internal energy is
equal to zero i.e., AU = 0.

8.8 CARNOT’S ENGINE

A Carnot heat engine is a theoretical engine that operates on the principle of Carnot cycle. This
concept was introduced by Sadi Carnot in 1824. A heat engine operetng * in an ideal reversible
cycle between a heat source and a heat sink
would be the most efficient. engine. For the
operation of Carnot engine, we consider Carnot |
cycle using an ideal gas as working substance. The
engine is the
isothermal and adiabatic processes. Carnot’s
engine works in a cycle on the isothermal
* isothermal
compression and finally adiabatic compression to
reach the initial state while taking some useful

work at output. This working process in the form |
of P-V diagram is shown in Fig. 8.16. This cycle

working principle of Carnot’s

expansion, adiabatic expansion,

can be explained in four steps as:

1) Isothermal Expansion: In the first step, the gas is allowed to expand isothermally at

in physics that addresses the direction of natural processes and
even the concept of entropy. This law explains the heat
naturally flows from hot objects to cold ones and not the
opposite way i.e. from cold to hot one. This can be explained
if you put a cup of hot tea in a room with air-conditioner ts
running the tea will cool down due to low temperature of the
room but when you switch off the A.C and after sometime the
temperature of the room increases but the tea will not get

RTI HEAT AND THERMODYNAMICS ,

2) Adiabatic Expansion: In this step, the cylinder is insulated so that gas neither absorbs nor
releases the heat, as shown in Fig. 8.17 (B). The gas expands adiabatically, causing the
temperature of the gas drops from high temperature T; to a low temperature T2. As shown in
adiabat (the portion of cycle represented by ‘bc’ in Fig. 8.16), the pressure further decreases
to P3 and volume further increases to V3, causing the piston moves outwards by doing work, as
shown in Fig. 8.17 (B).

3) Isothermal Compression: In this process, the gas is kept at low temperature T2 and it
compresses by rejecting heat Q:, as shown in Fig. 8.17 (C). The pressure in this case increases
to P4 while volume decreases to V, and hence work is done on the gas. The isotherm for this
case is represented by curve ‘cd’ in Fig. 8.16.

Adiabatic Compression: Finally, the gas is once again placed in insulated cylinder, ensuring
that no heat enters or leaves the gas. The gas is compressed adiabatically to increase its
temperature from T2 to Ty, as shown in Fig. 8.17 (D). During this step, the pressure increases
to P; and volume decreases to V;, as shown in Fig. 8.16 represented by curve ‘da’.

Thermal and mechanical equilibrium is maintained throughout the process to make it perfectly
reversible. As the working substance returns to its initial state, so there is no change in internal
energy i.e., AU = 0.

Conclusion: oy above result, it is clear that oe of Cnet anane i) is caeeoutand of
nature of working substance. It depends only on the temperatures of hot and cold reservoirs.

For the efficiency to be 100 % the ratio of temperatures should be zero. This will only happen
if T: = 0 or T; =o, which is impossible because we do not have reservoir at absolute zero
temperature or infinite temperatures. Therefore, it is impossible for a real engine to have an
efficiency of 100 %.

' Carnot’s theorem states that no heat engine can be more peratures a

In most of the cases, the cold reservoir is our atmosphere. In order to increase the efficiency
of heat engine, we have to increase the temperature of hot reservoir. All real heat engines are
less efficient than Carnot’s engine due to heat losses.

Example 8.4: Find the efficiency of a heat engine operating between 400 °C and 30 °C.

8.9 REFRIGERATOR

We know that in nature, heat flows from hotter body towards
colder body. If we want to move heat from a colder to a hotter
body, we need to reverse the working of heat engine, and work
is to be done on the system.

A refrigerator is a device designed to remove heat from a reg
that is at lower temperature than its surroundings, == |
The same device can be used to heat a space that is at higher
temperature than the surroundings. In this case, the device is
called Heat Pump, as shown in Fig. 8.18. In refrigerators, heat
flows from lower temperature source to higher temperature —
sink. In other words, we can also define refrigerator as:

Some work W is performed by the compressor of the refrigerator on the working substance. The

No cyclic device has ever been built that can extract heat ‘Q:’ from a cold reservoir and reject
it entirely into a hot reservoir without expenditure of work. .

Given: Low temperature ‘T2’ = 6 °C ‘High temperature ‘Ty’ = 37 °C

8.10 ENTROPY

The concept of entropy was introduced into the study of thermodynamics by Rudolph Clausius
in 1856 to provide a quantitative statement to second law of thermodynamics. It introduced

another state variable, along with temperature, pressure, volume and internal energy. Entropy
can be defined in many ways.

A thermodynamic quantity that represents the unavailability of a system’s thermal energy for
conversion into mechanical work is called entropy. A

It is simply the degree of disorder or randomness in a system. For mathematical derivation
of entropy, consider a system undergoes a reversible process during which it absorbs an ampunt
of heat AQ at an absolute temperature T. The increase in state variable called ey S of the
system is given by:

AS=— ___ (8.12 ~
From this equation, we find that:

Entropy is the measure of a system’s thermal energy per unit temperature that is unavailable
for doing useful work.

Like potential energy and intertel energy, it is Gunes in enecoeey which is important rather
than the absolute value of entropy. Examples of entropy changes include:

¢ Burning of wood, as wood converts into ash, smoke and gases, releasing the stored energy
within the wood.

8.10.1 Sign Convention for Entropy

During a change, the sign of entropy is important consider. It depends on the direction of heat
flow, i.e., whether heat is added to the system or removed from the system.

. The change in entropy is positive if heat is added to the system.

e The change in entropy is negative if heat is removed from the system.
Suppose heat Q flows from a heat source at temperature T; to a heat sink at temperature To.
The change in entropy of the heat source can be given as —Q/7,, as the source loses heat, so
its entropy is negative. The entropy of sink is given as +Q/T,. As T; > T2, the net change in

entropy will be positive:

This equation shows that in all natural processes where heat flows from hotter body to colder
body, there is a net increase in entropy. We can define second law of thermodynamics in terms
of entropy as follows:

Entropy requires a particular direction for time, known as “Arrow of Time”. As one goes
‘forward’ in time the entropy of isolated system increases, hence entropy measurement is a

es in entropy means the degradation of energy. =
For example, in a car engine the burning of fuel produces some work while the remaining heat
energy is released into the atmosphere. The heat energy released into the atmosphere is no
longer available for work. Before entropy change, all the heat from this process was available
for work, but after the process a major part of heat energy is lost into the atmosphere.
Even in the case of reverse processes such as in refrigerator or air conditioner, the temperature
of one system decreases at the expense of an increase in the temperature of another system.

When these systems are considered together as universe, the entropy of universe always
increases.

fusion for ice is L;= 3.36x10° J kg". Also discuss the sign of the entropy changes.

Assignment 8.6:
A body at 150 °C undergoes a reversible isothermal process. The heat energy removed in
the process is 7373 J. Find the entropy change of the body.

Second law of thermodynamics gives us clues to tackle with environmental crisis we are facing right now.
In fact, environmental crisis arises due to our efforts to bring order to the nature for our comforts, which
is against law of nature that is why we can say that environmental crisis is entropy crisis.

The energy processes we use are not efficient, as a result most of the energy is lost to the environment,
causing thermal pollution, as heat is the ultimate death of any form of energy i.e., whenever any type
of energy is converted completely into heat energy it is now no longer available for doing useful work.
With thermal pollution most of the heat engines we use cause air pollution.

HEAT AND THERMODYNAMICS

SUMMARY

? Thermodynamics | is that branch of physics in which we study the transformation of heat

into other forms of energy.

Thermal energy is the energy possessed by a system due to movement of its particles.

internal energy is the energy associated with the random and disordered motion of

molecules of a substance.

In thermodynamics, work is the product of pressure and change in volume of the system.

First law of thermodynamics states that when heat is added to a system, it increases the

internal energy of the system plus work is done on the environment.

* An isothermal process is a thermodynamic process in which temperature remains constant
throughout the process.

* An adiabatic process is a thermodynamic process in which no heat or mass transfers
between the system and the surroundings.

* An isochoric or constant volume process is a thermodynamic process in which volume of
the system remains constant.

* An isobaric or constant pressure process is a thermodynamic process in which pressure of
the system remains constant.

% A heat engine is a device that converts heat energy into mechanical work.

* Second law of thermodynamics states that it is impossible for a heat engine to convert
heat taken from a single reservoir entirely into work without leaving any change in the
working substance,

* Carnot’s theorem states that, no heat engine can be more efficient than a Carnot engine
operating between the same two temperatures.

Waves transfer energy from one location to another, In this chapter, we will study about

All waves carry energy and sometimes their energy can be directly observed. For example,
earthquakes can shake whole cities, performing the work of thousands of wrecking balls, Loud
sounds can damage nerve cells in the inner ear, causing permanent hearing loss. Ultrasound ts

Water waves abolish beaches.

Energy carried bya wave per unit area in unit time {s called intensity.

The amount of intensity in a progressive wave is directly related to square of its amplitude, as
shown in the following relation:

So, an earthquake having large amplitude produce large ground displacements. The energy of
a wave depends on time as well. For example, the longer deep-heat ultrasound is applied, the
more energy it transfers. Waves can also be concentrated or spread out. For example, sunlight
can be focused to burn wood. Earthquakes spread out, / do less damage as farther they

Possibly you hana’ noticed how the sound of a vehicle’s horn changes as the vehicle moves away
from you. The frequency of the sound you hear appears higher as the vehicle approaches you
and appears lower as it moves away from you. This phenomenon is known as Doppler’s Effect,
named after an Austrian physicist Christian Doppler (1803-1853), who described it in 1842.

The apparent change inthe frequency of a wave due tothe relat Motion between the
observer and the source is called Doppler’s effect. . Bey Ae te

The Doppler’s effect is most often associated with sound, however it’s common to all waves,
including water and light. In deriving the Doppler’s effect, we assume the air is stationary and
all speed measurements are made relative to this stationary medium.

Motion of a source of sound toward an observer increases the rate at which he or she receives
the vibrations. The velocity of each vibration is the speed of sound whether the source is moving
or not. Each vibration from an approaching source has a shorter distance to travel. The
wavelength is shortened when the source is moving towards the observer and is lengthened
when it is moving away from the observer. The vibrations are therefore received at a higher
frequency than they are sent. Similarly, sound waves from a receding source are received at a
lower frequency than they are sent.

As a result, the wavelength A’ measured by listener A is shorter than the wavelength A of the

Hence, when the source moves away from a stationary listener, the frequency of sound

9.2.1 Applications of Doppler’s Effect

Doppler’s effect has many interesting applications. It is applied in weather observation to
characterize cloud movement and weather patterns, and has other applications in aviation and
radiology. We will discuss some of the most significant applications of the Doppler’s effect in the
following:

e SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging) helps to detect the speed of ships, aeroplanes
and submarines using the Doppler’s effect. When sound waves are reflected from a
moving body such as submarine, their frequency changes. This change in frequency
allows us to calculate the speed and direction of the submarine.

e The velocity of Earth’s satellites is determined from the Doppler shift in frequency of
the radio waves they transmit.

e Doppler’s Effect can be used in radar system to find the speed and direction of
aeroplanes. Radar systems send out radio waves. If the frequency of the reflected radio
waves from an aeroplane decreases, then the aeroplane is moving away from the radar.
If the frequency of the reflected radio waves from an aeroplane increased, then the
aeroplane is moving toward the radar.

159

--- PAGE 160 ---
“ive WAVES

The Doppler’s effect is of great interest to astronomers, who use shift in the frequency
of electromagnetic waves produced by moving stars in our galaxy and beyond in order
to gather information about those stars and galaxies. In 1929, Edwin Hubble observed
that all galaxies appeared to be red-shifted (i.e. moving away from us and each other),
leading him to propose that the universe is expanding. Specific information about stars
within galaxies can be determined by using the Doppler’s effect.

HOST STAR

appear to be shifted to lower in frequencies (a red shift) if the star is moving away from
the Earth. On the other hand, there is an upward shift in frequency (a blue shift) of such
observed radiation if the star is moving towards the Earth.

Doppler effect is used to measure speed in
RADAR sensors. This is known as radar speed
traps. When a fixed-frequency radio wave sent

by the sender continuously strikes an object |

moving towards or away from the sender, the
frequency of the reflected radio wave will be
changed due to the object's motion. Thus,
analyzing the frequency of the reflected wave
one can find the speed of moving object.

Doppler effect is used in the diagnosis of
cardiac diseases. Doppler ultrasound (or
Doppler echocardiography) is a test in which
very high frequency sound waves are bounced
off the heart and blood vessels. The returning
sound waves are picked up and turned into
pictures showing blood flow through the
arteries or the heart. Doppler ultrasound

testing allows doctors to clearly see flow of blood through the heart and blood vessels.
It also allows them to see and measure obstructions in arteries and measure the degree

9.3, SUPERPOSITION OF WAVES ee

Various wave phenomena in nature require two or more waves passing through the same region
of space at the same time. Two travelling waves can meet and pass through each other without
being vanished or even altered.

When two waves of same nature pass through the same medium, their interaction may cause
to the formation of a new wave. In the region of overlap, the resultant wave is found by adding
the displacements of the individual waves. For such aya, the superposition i

In Fig. 9.3, you can see two waves (X
and Y) superposing to form the
resultant wave (Z). The diagram shows
only three points where it displays how
the displacement of the resultant wave
is calculated.

For example, when time t = 0, the
displacement of the Y wave is -0.9
(signs must be taken into account as
displacement is a vector quantity) and
the displacement of the X wave was .
-2.1. As a result, the displacement of
the resultant wave will be the vector
sum of those, (-0.9) + (-2.1) = -3. This
is simply the principle of superposition.

The superposition of waves can lead to
the following three effects:

--- PAGE 162 ---
1. When two waves having the same frequency travel with the same speed along the same
direction in a specific medium, then they superpose and create an effect known as the
interference of waves.

2. When two waves having same frequencies travel with the same speed along opposite
directions in a specific medium, then they superpose to produce stationary waves.

3. When two waves having slightly different frequencies travel with the same speed along the

same direction in a specific medium, they superpose to produce beats.

9.4.2 Interference of Sound Waves

One simple device for demonstrating interference of sound Path length ry
waves is illustrated in Fig. 9.5 (a). Sound from a
loudspeaker S is sent. into a tube at point P, where there is
a T-shaped junction. Half the sound energy travels in one
direction, and half travels in the opposite direction.
Therefore, the sound waves that reach the receiver R can
travel along either of the two paths. The lower path length
ris fixed, but the upper path length r,can be varied by
sliding the U-shaped tube.

e If the two paths are equal, then both the waves arrive
at R, are in phase. So, loud sound is heard due to
constructive interference.

e If the sound waves are stopped at Q by pinching the rubber portion of tube, then loud sound
is heard again. This proves that silence is due to destructive interference of the two sound
waves.

Noise-canceling Headphones

Noise-canceling headphones (as shown in Fig. 9.5 b) uses the principle of superposition to
attenuate the environmental noise inside the ear cup of the headphone. The basic idea is to
sense the unwanted sound wave coming from the noisy environment and produce an appropriate
canceling sound wave through a loudspeaker. The canceling wave should match the noise in
amplitude and has the opposite phase (i.e., 180° out of phase).

canceling sound Wave Unwanted sound is

In this way, the cancelling sound wave will destructively interfere with the environmental noise
and the noise component will be effectively attenuated.

9.5 Beats sins

Beats are the interference effect results from the superposition of two waves with slightly
different frequencies. When two sound waves having slightly different frequencies encounter
each other, then the amplitude of sound waves is added and subtracted alternatively through
a given period. Hence, the sound grows louder and softer through the given period and
fluctuating sound (alternate soft and loud sound) is heard. It is important to note that, the loud
sensation of sound is produced by the constructive interference. On the other hand, the soft
sound is instigated due to destructive “ra

constructive interference. Therefore, the sound intensity rises for this certain period. However,
for an interval of time, the crest of B overlaps the trough of A. This causes destructive
interference.

Beats became:

So, if two sound waves with frequencies of 32 Hz and 30 Hz are aan simultaneously, a beat

frequency of 2 Hz will be detected. If the numbers of beats per second are more than 10, then
the beats can’t be heard as separate.

Application of Beats
Beats are very useful to compare frequencies, finding the unknown frequency, tuning the
musical instrument, in ultrasonic imaging and radar speed traps.

165

--- PAGE 166 ---
Musicians utilizes the phenomenon of beats to tune a piano string. They pluck the string and
tap a tuning fork at the same time. If the two sound sources: the piano string and the tuning
fork, produce detectable beats then their frequencies are not identical. They will then adjust
the tension of the piano string and repeat the process until the beats can no longer be heard.
As the piano string becomes more in tune with the tuning fork, the beat frequency will be
reduced and approach 0 Hz. When beats are no longer heard, the piano string is tuned to the
tuning fork; that is, they play the same frequency as the tuning fork. This process allows a
musician to match the strings’ frequency to the frequency of a standardized set of tuning
forks. :

Example 9.3: Two musical instruments are sounded together to produce beats. Evaluate
the beat frequency of these two sound waves having frequencies 750 Hz and 390 Hz

respectively? .
Given: fy = 750 Hz f, = 390 Hz

Solution: The beat frequency can be calculated using the formula: p

Stationary wave is formed by the superposition of two or more identical waves, moving in

go by. The displacement of the particles of waves are shown at seven different positions at t

The displacement of points 2, 4 and 6 has maximum amplitude but rapidly oscillating up and

to the sum of amplitude of the component waves. Antinodes are usually represented by A and
node are usually represented by N. This pattern of nodes and antinodes form a stationary wave
because they appear to be standing, not moving through space like progressive waves. So,
standing wave is confined in a given region of space.

Characteristics of Stationary Waves

A stationary wave has the following important characteristics:

(i) No energy is transferred from particle to particle in stationary waves.

(ii) The distance between two successive nodes or anti-nodes is equal to A/2.
(iii) The distance between adjacent node and anti-node is equal to A/4.

9.6.1 Stationary Waves in a Stretched String

Stationary waves can be setup in any media which do not transmit energy from one point to

another point. Standing waves are also found on the strings of musical instruments and are
produced due to the reflections of waves from the ends of the string. Consider a string of length

so that the tension in the string is T, as shown _

in Fig. 9.8 (a). To find the frequencies of

9.7 STATIONARY WAVES IN AIR COLUMN RIE acs

Standing waves can also be generated in air columns such as organ pipes. Organ pipe is a musical

instrument. It consists of a long tube which produces sound by mean of vibrating air column,
_ Flute, trombone, clarinet, etc. are familiar examples of organ pipes. Organ pipes can be open

or closed. If both ends of an organ pipe are open, then it is called open organ pipe. If one end
- of an organ pipe is closed, then it is called closed organ pipe.

Suppose we have a tube that is closed at one end and open at the other. If we hold a vibrating
tuning fork near the open end of the tube, an incident sound wave travels through the tube and
reflects off the closed end. The reflected sound has the same frequency and wavelength as the
incident sound wave, but is traveling in the opposite direction. At the closed end of the tube,
the molecules of air have very little freedom to oscillate, and a node arises. At the open end,
the molecules are free to move, and at the right frequency, an antinode occurs and the air
column in the tube resonates loudly. The standing wave formed in the tube has an antinode at
the open end and a node at the closed end. A portion of the sound wave is reflected back into
the tube even at an open end. The distance from a node to an antinode is one-fourth of a
wavelength, arid this equals the length of the tube thus, L = 1/4 A.

Polarization is a phenomenon associated to transverse waves. A light wave is
an electromagnetic wave. An electromagnetic wave is a special type of transverse wave that
has both an electric and a magnetic component, as shown in Fig. 9.11 (a).

Ordinarily, a ray of light consists of a number of waves vibrating in all the directions
perpendicular to its line of propagation. Light emitted by the sun, a lamp, or by a candle flame
are created by electric charges that vibrate in various directions, thus creating a variety of
electromagnetic wave

that vibrates in several | — ) -—_ : oe ea
planes perpendicular to
its line of propagation, ”

as shown in Fig. 9.11 |.
(b). A light wave that is
vibrating in more than
one plane is referred to
as unpolarized light. It
is possible to transform
~ unpolarized light [aaa
into polarized = light. (2 —
Polarized light waves are light waves in which the vibrations occur in a tr ain aa

There are a variety of methods of polarizing light, as discussed below.
9.8.1 Polarization by a Polaroid Filter

The one most common method of polarization includes the use of a Polaroid filter.

Polaroid filters are made of a special material that is capable of blocking all the planes of
vibration of an electromagnetic wave and transmit only one plane of vibration, as shown in Fig.
9.11 (b). So, a Polaroid serves as a device that filters out one plane of the vibrations upon
transmission of the light through the filter. When unpolarized light is transmitted through a
Polaroid filter, it emerges as polarized light, i.e., its intensity reduces to half and with
vibrations ina singe plane.

plane of vibration.
When unpolarized light passes

through a polaroid filter its intensity reduces and only light parallel to the grid axis within the
polarizing filter is allowed to pass,

The axis of polarization of transmitted light is the same as the filter that polarizing it. It is then
perfectly plane polarized light. When perfectly plane polarized light is incident on an analyzer,

the cosine of angle between the transmission axis of the analyzer and the polarizer.

The equation (9.26) is known as Malus’s law.

9.8.2 Polarization by Reflection

Unpolarized light can also polarized by
reflection from nonmetallic surfaces,
as shown in Fig. 9.11 (c). The amount
to which polarization occurs is
dependent upon the angle at which the
light incident to the surface and

vibrational directions; such reflected
light is unpolarized. However, nonmetallic surfaces such as water and asphalt roadways, reflect

light such that there is a large concentration of vibrations in a plane parallel to the reflecting
surface. A person viewing objects by means of light reflected off of nonmetallic surfaces will
often perceive a glare if the extent of polarization is large. Fishermen are familiar with this
glare since it prevents them from seeing fish that lie below the water surface. Light reflected

off a lake is partially polarized in a direction parallel to the water's surface. Fishermen know
that the use of glare-reducing sunglasses with the proper polarization axis allows for the
blocking of this partially polarized light. By blocking the plane-polarized light, the glare is
reduced and the fisherman can more easily see fish located under the water.

9.8.3 Uses of Polaroids

Polaroids in Sky Photography:
Polaroid sunglasses are familiar to most of
us. They have a special ability to reduce
the glare of light reflected from water or
sky. A camera used to photograph the
clouds is fitted with a polaroid before the
camera lens. The light coming from sky is
polarized by polaroid. Thus, the
background becomes sufficiently dark
against which a clear photograph is
obtained.

Polaroids in Stress Analysis: In plastic industry, polaroid is used to perform stress analysis
tests on transparent plastics. As light passes through a plastic, each color of visible light is
polarized with its own direction. If such a plastic is placed between two polarizing plates, a
colorful pattern is observed. As the top plate is turned, the color pattern changes as new colors
become blocked and the formerly blocked colors are transmitted. Structural stress in plastic is
signified at locations where there is a large concentration of colored bands. This location of
stress is usually the location where structural failure will most probably occur.

Polaroids are also used in the entertainment industry to display 3-D movies.
Example 9.5: An Unpolarized light having intensity of = 16 W m7 is incident on a pair of
polarizers. The first polaroid filter has its transmission axis at 50° from the vertical, The
second polaroid filter has its transmission axis at 20° from the vertical. Calculate the
intensity of the light transmitted through both the filters.
Given: Intensity unpolarized light = lo = 16 W m7?

Transmission axis of 1* polarizer from the vertical = 50°

Transmission axis of 2™ polarizer from the vertical = 20°
To Find: Intensity of the light transmitted = | =?
Solution: First, we calculate the intensity of the light when it emerges from the first polarizer.
As the light is unpolarized, so

ly =lo/2=16/2=8Wm?

Now we calculate the intensity of the light when it emerges from the second polaroid filter.
As, when it emerges from the first polaroid filter the light is linearly polarized at 50°. The angle
between this light and the transmission axis of the second polaroid filter is 50°- 20°= 30°

Therefore, ln = 1 cos? 30° = 8 x (0.866)? = 8 x 0.75 =6 Wm?

Oe DIF TRACTION

To observe the diffraction
effect in water, we generate
plane waves of water in a ripple
tank and place two obstacles in
line in such a way that
separation between them is
equal to the wavelength of
water waves, as shown in Fig.
9.12. After passing through the
small slit between the two
obstacles, the water waves will
spread around the slit and
change into almost semicircular
pattern (Fig. 9.12 a).

Diffraction of waves can only be
observed clearly if the size of
the obstacle is comparable with the wavelength of the wave. if the size of the obstacle is larger
than the wavelength of the wave, then only a small. | a
diffraction occurs near the corners of the obstacle, as
shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). :

Diffraction can also be, observed in light waves, when a
beam of monochromatic light passes through a narrow slit
or beam of monochromatic light passes over a knife edge.
The diffraction of light can be observed only if size of the
opening or obstacle is small enough to be comparable with
wavelength of light used.

Consider a beam of light passing through a single slit and =
falls on the photographic film, as shown in Fig. 9.13. The | "'®

central bright band (also called fringe) is of high intensity

and very wider than the slit and other surrounding bands. These bands are the result of
interference effect.

Gravitational waves are actually the ripples in spacetime.
When objects move, the curvature of spacetime changes
_and these changes move away (like ripples on water
surface) as gravitational waves.

Every physical object, .that accelerates, produces ' nae
gravitational waves. This includes humans, vehicles, airplanes etc. But theomasses so
accelerations of objects on Earth are too much small to make gravitational waves big enough
to be detected with our instruments. To find big enough gravitational waves, we have to see
far away outside of our solar system. The Universe is filled with extremely massive objects
undergoing quick accelerations that generate gravitational waves which can be detected.
Examples of some events that could cause a gravitational wave are:

e When a star explodes asymmetrically, called a supernova.
« When two big stars orbit each other.
¢ When two black holes orbit each other and collide to merge.

9.10.1 Interferometer

Interferometer are tools used for investigation in many fields of science and engineering. They
are called interferometers because they work on interference of two or more light to create an
interference pattern, This pattern can be measured and analyzed. The interference patterns
generated by interferometers contain information about the object or phenomenon being
studied. They are often used to make very small measurements that are not possible by any
other way. That is why they are so powerful for detecting gravitational waves. LIGO's
interferometers are designed to measure a distance of 1/10,000th the width of a proton, small
enough!

We know that all matter is made up of atoms. These atoms are composed of electrons, protons,
and neutrons. Each proton has one unit of positive charge and each electron has one unit of
negative charge. A neutron has no charge. Protons and neutrons are tightly packed in the
nucleus while electrons can be thought of as small charged clouds that surround the nucleus of
atoms. An atom normally has an equal number of electrons and protons making it electrically
neutral. If an electron is removed from an atom, then the atom acquires a net positive charge.

if an extra electron is added to an atom, it acquires a net negative charge. In the cover picture,
it is shown that when we rub a comb in our hairs, the comb gets charged. When this charged
comb is brought to the pieces of papers, these pieces get attracted due to induction. The study
of electric charges at rest and the forces between them is referred to as electrostatics.

In this chapter, we investigate electric forces and discuss about the various phenomena
associated with the positive and negative charges.

40.1 _CoULoma’s LAw | RTP? a
A French physicist Charles Coul Coulomb (1 (1736- 1806) secteinid experiments for the electrostatic

force and proposed a formula to calculate it. The mathematical formula for the electrostatic
force is called Coulomb's law. This law is defined as:

If we consider two point nihohentd q; and qz separated by distance
r, as shown in Fig. 10.1. According to Coulomb's law, the
magnitude of the force F is given by:

F « qiq2

Fa =

By combining above two relations, we get:

Here k is the constant of proportionality, known as eel constant. It is typically expressed

in terms of permittivity of fee space Eo. i.e. k=

oa
Here £.= 8.85x10°'? C? N"' m7?

This is mathematical form of coulomb's law. The equation (10.2) represents the force between
the two charges when there is vacuum between them.

h

--- PAGE 186 ---
ELECTROSTATICS —

The value of k depends upon system of units used and medium between the charges. In SI
system, k =9x 10? N m?C™, This value of k is applicable if there is vacuum between the
charges. Coulomb’s law is applicable to point charges and uniform spherical charge distribution.

A point charge is an imaginary charge located at a single point in space. An electron can be
considered a point charge.

A charged sphere also behaves as a point charge for a point outside the spherical conductor.
This is due to the reason that the electric field at any point outside a spherical charge
distribution is the same as the field that would be produced by a point charge located at its
center. This is true only if the spherical conductor is isolated. If another charged object is
brought near the spherical conductor, it will induce surface charges in the spherical conductor
that are not spherically symmetric, and therefore, we can no longer treat it as a point charge.

When using Coulomb’s force law, remember that force is a vector quantity and must be treated
accordingly. Coulomb’s law in vector form for the electric force exerted on a charge q, bya
second charge q2, is written as:

Fy, = kB 1192 (10.3)

Where, 7,2 is unit vector in the direction of F,>. Similarly, the electric force exerted on a
charge q, by a charge q;, is written as: ~

A comparison of coulomb’s force and gravitational force shows that both act at a distance
without direct contact, such force is called field force. Both are inversely proportional to the
distance squared, with the force directed along a line connecting the two bodies. The
mathematical form is the same, with the masses m; and m2in Newton’s law replaced by charges
q: and q2 in Coulomb's law and with Newton’s constant G replaced by Coulomb’s constant k.
There are two important differences: electric forces can be either attractive or repulsive,
whereas gravitational forces are always attractive. Additionally, the electric force between
charged elementary particles is far stronger than the gravitational ——
force between the same particles. q, -

The Superposition Principle of Force: When we have number of
charges ina certain region, then each charge experiences a net force
‘ due to all other charges placed at suitable distance. These electric
forces can all be Computed separately, one at a time, then added as ©
vectors. This is an example of the superposition principle. 4, q,

The following example illustrates this procedure in two dimensions.
Example 10.1: Three point charges are located at the corners of a right triangle, as shown
in figure 10.3, where q, = q3 = 5.00 pC, q2 = — 2.00 pC, and a = 0.100 m. Find the resultant
force exerted on q3. oO PY

Given: q, =q3=5.00pC, qz=—2.00yC, a= 0.100 m.

To Find: F, =?

Solution: As charge q;is near two other
charges, it will experience two elec‘ric forces.
These forces are exerted in different c’rections,
as shown in Fig. 10.3. Because two fo’ces’ are
exerted on charge q3, we solve this example by
using superposition principle.

The force F;, exerted on q3 by qz is attractive
because q, and q,have opposite signs. In the
coordinate system, the attractive force F32 is to
the left (in the negative x-direction). The force
F,,exerted on q3by q,is repulsive because both
charges are positive. The repulsive force F;,
makes an angle of 45° with the x-axis.

10.2 ELECTRIC FIELD INTE BAS ISiTY

An electric field, like onher fields (e.g., gravitational. or aap is a vector field that
surrounds the charged object. Electric fields are found around electric charges and help
determine the direction and magnitude of force the charge exerts on a nearby charged
particle. The concept of a field was developed by
Michael Faraday (1791-1867) in the context of electric
forces. It is defined as:

The region around a charge in which a test charge ©
can feel an electric force is called electric field. _
An electric field is said to exist in the region of space
around a charged object, the source charge. When
another charged object called the test charge enters
this electric field, an electric force acts on it. As an
example, consider Fig. 10.4, which shows a small
positive test charge q placed near a second object |
carrying a much greater positive charge Q. The
electric field vector E at a point in space is defined as |
the electric force F acting on a positive test charge q
placed at that point, divided by the magnitude of test
charge. If test charge q is moved away from the source

7 4 ean enenenenensneneemennen

188

--- PAGE 189 ---
charge Q, the force will decrease till a certain distance, and after that the force will practically
reduce to zero. This is because of the fact that now q is not in the field of Q.

Electric field intensity E is a single vector quantity containing information about the field
strength and its direction at a point. The strength of the field at a point in space determines
the amount of force that a charge will experience if it is placed at that point. The direction in
which this unit positive test charge will move or tends to move is the direction of the electric
field. The test charge is so small that it does not distort the original field due to the primary
source.

if F is the force experienced by a test charge q placed inside the field, then the value of electric
intensity E at that’ point is given as:

If we use coulomb’s law, F= K29p, then the above equation appears as:

The SI unit of E is newton per coulomb (N C~') or volt per metre (V m"). The strength of the
field is proportional to the magnitude of the source charge. Its strength decreases as the test

charge moves away from source charge. £ is always directed from positive to negative
charges.

Example 10.2: Determine electric field at the surface of a sphere of radius 3.0 m if a point
charge of 9 pC is placed at the centre.

10. 3 ELECTRIC FIELD LINES

A way of vieuattzing electric field patter ist to arkaws lines, called
electric field lines. Electric field lines were first introduced by
Faraday.

The direction and intensity of electric field in the vicinity of &
charge body can be represented by drawing imaginary li
called electric lines of force.

It is important to remember that acti fields are dente
dimensional. Two-dimensional representation of electric field
lines for the field due to a single positive point charge is shown .
in Fig. 10.5. This two-dimensional drawing shows only the field | Rsire 0.5: Hechale tv

lines that lie in the plane containing the point charge. Le in 2- dimension:

The electric field lines are actually directed radially outward aa
from positive charge in all directions; therefore, instead of the
flat “wheel” of lines shown, you should picture an entire

spherical distribution of lines. ~ y-
The electric field lines representing the field due to a single

negative point charge are directed toward the charge (Fig. 10.6). IR
In either case, the lines are along the radial direction and extend

all the way to infinity. Notice that the lines become closer as

they approach the charge, indicating that the strength of the
field increases as we move towards the source charge.

Figure 10.7 shows the symmetric electric field lines for two PHS |
charges of equal magnitude but opposite sign. This
charge configuration is called an electric dipole. Note
that the field lines start from positive charge and ends
at negative charge. The high density of lines between
the charges indicates a strong electric field in this
region. Thus, field is stronger in the region between the
charges because the resultant intensity is equal to the
sum of the intensities due to positive and negative
charges. The number of lines that begin at the positive
charge must equal the number of lines that terminate at
the negative charge.

ee 10.6: Electri
lines of isolated n

190

--- PAGE 191 ---
Figure 10.8 shows the field lines of two positive charges.
At some points, situated between the two charges, the
resultant intensity is zero, which creates a field free
region. Two negative charges also produce the fields
very similar to the field produced by two positive
charges, except that the directions are reversed.

The electric lines of force between two oppositely
charged parallel plates separated by a small distance is
shown in Fig. 10.9. One plate has a uniform positive
charge distribution while the other has a uniform
negative charge distribution. The field lines start from
the positive plate and end at negative plate. The field

between the plates is uniform in strength. If the plates. |
have finite length, then field lines at the ends of plates

will curve, as shown in Fig. 10.9. Such curved field at the
ends of plates is called "fringing field". Fringing field
shows that field is not uniform at the ends.

From the above discussion, we conclude that:
e The field lines never intersect each other.

The potential gradient represents the rate of change of electric
potential with respect to displacement. In other words, it
represents the slope along which potential is changing.

The tangent drawn to any point on a field line indicates the direction of electric intensity
at that point. The arrows indicate the direction of electric field at various points.

The intensity of electric field is proportional to the number of electric field lines per unit

10.4.1 Motion of a Charged Particle in an Electric

Field

When a charge +q is placed in an electric field E, as shown in the Fig.
10.10 (b), it experiences a force in the electric field E.

e If the charge is allowed to move freely in the electric field, it will
move from positive plate to the negative plate and gain kinetic energy.

e If the charge is moved against the electric field, an external force
(F = +q E) is required. This increases the potential energy of the
charge. When the charge is released from its position, it will move back

and gain an equivalent amount of K.E.
10.5 FERROFLUID

A ferrofluid is a liquid which becomes highly
magnetized in the presence of a magnetic
field. Ferrofluid is composed of very small,
nanometer-sized particles (diameter usually 10
nm or less) of magnetite, hematite or some
other compound containing iron, and a liquid
(usually oil), These particles are suspended in
liquid. In the absence of magnetic field,
ferrofluid acts like a liquid. The magnetite
particles move freely in the fluid. In the
presence of magnetic field, the particles are
temporarily magnetized that react to the poles
of a magnet. Removing the external field will

lead to the disappearance of induced magnetic
field.

Ferrofluids “are colloidal suspensions

For Your Information
A Faraday cage is a cage made of a
conducting material. A Faraday cage
distributes charge or radiation around
the cage’s exterior, it cancels out
electric charges or radiation within the
cage. In short, a Faraday cage is a
hollow conductor, in which the charge
remains on the external surface of the
cage.

The fields within a conductor cancel out
with any external fields, so the electric
field within a conductor is zero. The
Faraday cages act as big hollow conductors. We can put ‘things into the Faraday cage to shield
them from electrical fields.

SUMMARY

* Coulomb’s law: The force of attraction or repulsion aki two aaaraen bodies is directly
proportional to the product of the magnitude of charges and inversely icici to the
square of distance between them.

@ Coulomb’s law is applicable to point charges and uniform spherical charge distribution.

* The Superposition Principle of Force: When a number of separate charges act on the
charge of interest, each exerts an electric force. These electric forces can all be computed
separately, one at a time, then added as vectors. This is known as the superposition
principle of force.

* Electric Field: The region around a charge where a test charge experiences an electric
force is called electric field.

Electric Lines of Force: The direction and intensity of the electric field around a charged
body can be represented by drawing imaginary lines called electric lines of force.

_% Charge: Property of matter that causes a force when near another charge. Charge comes
in two forms: positive and negative.

* Potential Gradient: The rate of change of electric potential AV with respect to displacement
Ar is known as potential gradient.

Electricity is the branch of physics in which we deal with dynamic state of charges. There
are two categories of electricity; static electric city and current electricity. The discharging
of electrical pulse due to imbalance of charges (Positive & Negative) refer the term Static
electricity, while movement of charge carriers by providing potential difference across
conductor represents the term current electricity. Basically, there are two types of
materials; one category which allow the flows of electric charge through it is named as good
conductors, for examples; aluminium, gold, steel, brass, copper etc., while second category
does not allow flow of charges is called bad conductor, for examples; wool, rubber, plastic,
wood etc.

11.1 | DRIFT VELOCITY

Bic ie BIOS 0) 8 CN ep
The term drift velocity of electrons in conductor refers the slow motion of electrons when
potential difference is applied across the conductor. In conductor; billions of electrons transfer
their energy to the neighboring electrons during collision when they move randomly, this makes
electrons’ flow possible. The drift velocity means the average velocity of free electrons by
which they are drifted towards high potential terminal of conductor in the presence of electric
field. This drifting behavior of electrons (within conductor) towards positive terminal is the
cause of drift current. Without the presence of external electric field, electrons acquire random
motion, while the external electric field bounds all electrons to move from low potential level
to high potential level, resultantly electrons acquire average drift velocity about 10° ms" and
net current is obtained.

The term “Current” represents the dynamic state of charges and the categories of current
based upon the direction of the flow of charges; means the electric and conventional flow
depends upon the nature of charges. Actually, electrons do not move parallel to the conductor’s
length like trucks on a road. In conducting material; billions of electrons are ready to push
neighboring electrons within inter-atomic spaces.

The average velocity of electrons within
conducting material without the existence of
an external electric field is shown in Fig. 11.1
(a). The concept of drift velocity cannot be
described without the presence of an external
electric field. The average value of Fermi
velocity of electrons in metals is Cuitipar atively
very high about 10°m s" (It does not depend
upon current and applied voltage) while the
drift velocity 10? ms".

in metals, during motion, electrons acquire energy, lose it when collide with each other, as a
result metal becomes hot. For the continuation of the flow of charges in metals, external

electric field is mandatory which helps to drift electrons.

During the elastic collision of electrons, the thermal velocities become high in the presence of

11.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL

Electric Potential Energy: Any charged particle experiences a force when it moves within
the region of constant electric field. i.e. F = Eq. It means that if we want to move any charge
carrier within a constant electric field, work is required which changes the electric potential

* energy of the charge carrier similar to the movement of any massive object in a uniform
gravitational field that requires work, which changes the potential energy of an object. When
an object moves naturally, there will be no requirement for external force or in other words
no need for expenditure of energy, but when an object moves against the natural forces, we
must require external energy, similar concept is used
in electric potential energy. Electric potential energy
is basically energy required by any charge carrier to
move against the electric field.

Let’s consider a charge carrier.q experiences a force
in constant electric field E, this positive charge will
move from the left plate to the right plate, i.e., from
a positively charged plate to a negatively charged
plate, as shown in Fig. 11,2 (a). If the distance - |
covered by charge is S in the direction of the electric
field, as shown in Fig. 11.2 (b), then work done is qES.

The electrostatic force is conservative in nature, so pe acivb Bos pag io Or electric tial:
it means that work done on charge a does not depend

upon the path followed. Basically, charged particle possesses electric potential energy when it
is placed in an electric field, so electric potential energy is the measurement of work done to

place a charged particle in an electric region from any infinite region.

11.3 ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE AND MAXIMUM POWER OUTPUT

We must require some kind of source named as emf source to accelerate charge carriers which
will be able to provide potential difference across the conducting material. The emf source
helps to convert chemical energy into electrical energy. The term
electromotive force is not representing the mechanical concept of
force rather it represents work per unit charge.

The potential difference of a cell can be expressed by the equation:

iS We e-I | : Rpt 3
whereas r is the internal resistance battery, as shown in Fig. 11.3.
The direction of flow of charges can be taken positive or negative
depending upon terminals-of emf source and the load of electric ie.

In many electronic circuits and systems, it is important to have
maximum transfer of power from the source to the load. For example, in radio or TV
transmitting systems, we want maximum power transfer from the transmitting medium to the
antenna systems. We want maximum power transfer from amplifier to speaker system. This is

accomplished by proper matching of load resistance R and source resistance r.

materials, which shows the ability of the atoms of that particular material to impede the flow
of electrons. The higher the resistivity the stronger the electrons will be attracted to the atoms,
and they will experience more difficulty in moving through the conducting material. Resistivity
is the intrinsic property while resistance is the extrinsic
property. The resistivity of the conducting material does not
depend upon the physical structure of the conductor. It does
not change by changing temperature until the material phase
transition occurs. In other words, we can say that resistivity is
a composition function, while resistance depends upon the
physical dimensions of the conducting material and the
temperature variation of the conducting material which plays a very effective role in increasing
and decreasing resistance. = oT

The conducting behavior of LDR can be better explained with the help of energy band theory.
Actually, the material reduces its conductance when incident light intensity reduces. Declining
graphical representation indicates inverse

behavior of resistance at different luminance

scales and darkness level, as shown in Fig. 11.5 (b).

Commonly, two types of LDR exists, i.e. Intrinsic

and extrinsic photo resistors. Intrinsic LDRs are

related to pure semiconducting material like

germanium or silicon etc. while extrinsic LDRs are

based upon modified semiconducting materials by
doping process, mostly these LDRs cannot be used

from 4 x 10° A° to 10* A’.

In dark environment, resistance of LDR acquires its maximum
value in MQ, while in lighted environment it reduces to few 100
©. Photo-resistors have lower photoelectric sensitivity at high
temperatures, but higher sensitivity at lower temperatures.
LDRs have sharp resistance recovery rate.

In potential divider circuit, LDR can be used because its
resistance can be increased or decreased by changing the
intensity of that light which falls on it, as shown in Fig. 11.5
(c). It means that by increasing or decrea: intensity of light :
the resistance of circuit can ed be fas 9 which affect the Figure 11.5 (c): LDR based
input potential dropped. Hence this is the one of the best POterietet civicee amass

practical application of LDR.

There are so many daily life practical applications of LDRs. Used as part of a SCADA (Supervisory Control
and Data Acquisition) system to perform functions such as counting the number of packages on a moving
conveyor belt; the most obvious aprlication for an LDR is to automatically turn on a light at a certain
light level. LDRs can be used to control the shutter speed on a camera. These are used as light sensors.
These are used to measure the intensity of light. Their latency property is used in audio compressors and
outside sersing. Infrared astronomy ard Infrared Spectroscopy also use photo resistors for measuring
mid-infrared spectral region. Photo resistors are available in small size; it is easy to carry from one place
to another place. Low cost, used in street lighting design, Alarm clocks, Burglar alarm circuits, Light

11.6 ELECTRIC POWER AND ELECTRIC ENERGY

The word electric power can be defined as the rate of
energy transferred. Let’s consider an electric circuit which
consists of a resistor having load resistance (R) is connected
with emf source, as shown in Fig. 11.6, the electric power
consumed in a given circuit can be measured as;

energy consumed by the electric circuit

Electric power = mr

The term power dissipation in resistor is due to energy loses
in term of heat energy. SI unit of electric power is watt. _ Figure 11.6: An electric circuit.

“1 watt = 1 volt x1 ampere

The energy required or acquired by charge carriers to move from one position to another
position is called electrical energy. When electrons move through resistor by provision of |
potential difference across the ends of conducting material, the concept of energy dissipation
can be analyzed in term of heat energy. In other words, one coulomb charge per unit time
(Q/t) drops due to potential difference (V), the rate of energy dissipation can be studied as VI.
So, Energy dissipation can be calculated with the help of power dissipation.

Energy dissipation=VQ= Vit = PRt = V?t/R
The commercial unit of electrical energy is ‘kilowatt-hour’.
~ Akilo watt hour = 1000 watt x 3600 seconds = 3.6 X 10° Joule

Example 11.4: Calculate 1-month cost of using 50 W energy saver for 8 hours daily in your
study room. Assume that the price of a unit is Rs. 20.

Given: Power (in watt) = = 50 watt Time (in hours) for 30 days = 8x30 = 240h
Cost per units = Rs, 20

To Find: Cost of electricity =?

Solution: As No of units = 2Ower (watt) x time ofuse in hours

1000
Putting values, we get: = ae = 12 unit

Cost of electricity = number of units x cost of 1 unit
= 12x20 = Rs. 240
Assignment 11.4
Estimate the cost of electricity consumed for a month, if the following devices are used as
specified: fi
i) 10 bulbs of 40 watts for 10 hours. iii) 40 tube lights of 25 watts for 10 hours.
ii) 10 fridges of 250 watts for 24 hours. (Given the rate of electricity is Rs. 50/unit).

1457 KIRCHHOFF’S LAWS

Gustay Robert Kirchhoff introduced laws related to two
electrical physical quantities “current” and “voltage” as
modified form of Ohm's work. Kirchhoff formulated a pair of laws
as practical applications of law of conservation of charge and
energy. These laws help in calculation of current in complex
combinations of resistances with more than one emf sources.

For example, the circuit in Fig. 11.7 shows a multi-loop circuit,
which consists of junctions (also known as a node). Here the
three resistors are connected and three emf sources are attached
to produce current. As the circuit is complex, the equivalent

; 11.7: A multi-t
resistance cannot be found here. The circuit cannot be solved by ch he

207

applying Ohm’s law, so Kirchhoff’s rules can be used instead of Ohm’s.
11.7.1 Kirchhoff’s First Law OR Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL)

According the Kirchhoff’s First law:
iar The currents entering the node always equal to currents leaving the node.

iTS Sabre: 4
Let’s consider five wires are connected at junction I Currents
point, representing the currents lj, lz, Is, ls and Is, where Node 1 In

1, lz, Is indicating the flow of charges entering the node
taken positive while I, and Is indicating the flow of

charges leaving from the node are taken negative, as
shown in Fig. 11.8.

+ hth +h ts=0 hence 57=0

Since charge can neither be created nor destroyed, so
the charge that has entered the junction as current
must leave in equal amount from the junction.
Thus, Kirchhoff’s Current law is just a specific
way of stating law of conservation of charge.

sum of potential differences, including A
voltage supplied by the voltage sources (emf) and voltage
drops in resistive elements (IR), in any loop must be equal
to zero. The convention is that, rise in potential is taken
as positive and drop in potential as negative, as shown in
Fig. 11.9 (a).

For example, consider a simple loop ABCDA with no
junctions, having two emf sources ‘e;’ and ‘ez’ with
internal resistances ‘r,’ and ‘r2’ and a resistor R:, as shown
in Fig. 11.9 (b).

Let’s us assume clockwise current ‘I’, and we travel the Sera be

resistor ‘r; there is drop in potential AVr; = Ir; is taken as negative. At ‘2’ the direction is from
positive to negative terminal of battery and there is drop in potential and is taken as negative.
Through internal resistor ‘rz’ again there is drop in potential AV,2 = IR2 and is taken as negative.
Thus, according to Kirchhoff’s Voltage law (KVL), we have:

AV, + AV, +AVp,.+ AV, + AV, =0
+ €, + (-Ir,)+(-IR,) +(—e,)+(-Ir,)=0
+ 6,—Ir,-IR,-6, -Ir, =0

This law is based on the conservation of energy whereby voltage is defined as the energy per
unit charge (V = AU/q.). The total amount of energy gained per unit charge must equal the
amount of energy lost per unit charge, as energy and charge are both conserved. Thus,
Kirchhoff’s voltage law is just a specific way of stating law of conservation of energy.

11.7.3 Applying Kirchhoff’s Laws

In order to solve problems by using Kirchhoff's |
Laws consider the circuit shown in Fig. 11.10. Let |
us take two closed loops:

e Loop 1 (ABCFA), assuming current ‘l;’ to |

“ee. D

be flowing through it.
e Loop 2 (CDEFC), assuming current ‘lz’ to & e,
be flowing through it. | |
The choice of loops is quite arbitrary, but it | eel
should be such that each resistance is included at | © A F R, a
least once in the selected loop. | Figure! 11,10: Complex circutt. Seated

The direction of assumed current is not

important; a wrong direction of assumed current will only indicate negative sign in the result.
If we go around the loop along the direction of assumed current 11, starting from point ‘A’. The
battery ‘e,’ is taken as positive because we are going from negative to positive terminal in the
branch from ‘A’ to ‘B’, At resistor ‘R;’ the drop in potential is taken as negative Va: = — IiR:. At
resistor R2 the drop in potential is taken as negative Va2 = — (I; + Iz) Re. Therefore, by applying
Kirchhoff’s Loop rule, we get:

&, + Va, + Ve. =0

If we go around the loop (CFEDC) along the direction of assumed current lz, starting from point
C. At resistor Rz the drop in potential is taken as negative Va = —(l; + h) Rz. At resistor R3 the
drop in potential is taken as negative Ve3= —R3. The battery ‘e,’ is taken as positive because
again we are going from negative to positive terminal in the branch from ‘E’ to ‘D’. Therefore,
by applying Kirchhoff’s Loop rule. Mathematically,

11.8 NULL METHOD OF MEASUREMENT

This method basically shows null reading on galvanometer which is used for comparison
between any known and unknown quantities. Null reading on galvanometer is used to find
resistance in a circuit named as Wheatstone bridge. Potentiometer is also one of the electrical
devices in which we use null method for finding potentials.

11.8.1. Wheatstone Bridge

Wheatstone bridge consists of four-resistors (three- |
known resistors while 1-unknown resistor) and a
galvanometer is connected between two points, say
b and d (Fig. 11.13). Whceatstone bridge becomes
balance when no _ deflection is seen on
galvanometer. The null reading measurement on |
galvanometer can help to calculate the value of _
unknown resistance. .
Let I; and lk be the currents through P and R
respectively when the bridge is balanced. Since
there is no current through Galvanometer, the
current in Q and S are also |; and |, respectively. As
the Galvanometer reads zero, points B and D are at
the same potential. Hence for balanced bridge: _ Figure 11.13: Wheatstone bridge circuit.

Vv @

A thermistor (short for thermal resistor) is a heat sensitive resistor; it means that the change
of temperature has direct relation with change of resistance. Samuel Ruben was the first
achiever who invented the first thermistor, which later on used for |
commercial purposes.

Thermistors are usually made of a semiconductor material |
(semiconductor oxides of iron, nickel and cobalt). Pair of platinum —
leads is attached at the two ends for electrical connections. The |
arrangement is enclosed in a very small glass bulb and sealed. They
are generally in the form of discs, rods, beads, etc., as shown ‘in
Fig. 11.15.

Thermistor can be categorized on the basis of numeric values of temperature co-efficient as:
negative temperature coefficient (NTC) and positive temperature coefficient (PTC). The
difference between NTC and PTC is inverse and direct relation of temperature and resistance
respectively. Positive temperature co-efficient of resistance means that the resistance

11.10 CARBON FIBERS IN CONCRETE BRIDGE

Carbon fibre-reinforced concrete has been used in
construction projects due to its ability to improve
compressive strength, tensile strength, elasticity
modulus, chemical stability, abrasion resistance
and corrosion resistance; reduce shrinkage cracks
and brittleness; light weightiness; good thermal
conductivity. Carbon fiber was introduced into
cercrete bridges (like shown in Fig. 11.18) to
improve the flexural strength and reduce the crack
width. Carbon fibers contain mainly carbon atoms
and are commonly used in civil engineering works.
The optimum carbon fiber amount should be 0.3 % by volume of concrete. Inspector can easily
check the reliability of concrete bridge made by carbon fibres because fiber conducts electricity

ELECTROMAGNETISM

Magnetism is the study of how a rnagnetic field, generated by a moving charged particle, affects
other charged particles or permanent magnets. Electromagnetism is the study of the magnetic
effects of current. In this unit, we shall study about the laws and phenomena related to
electromagnetism.

which a compass needle, a small
magnet, or a piece of ferromagnetic
material, and a moving charged
particle can experience a magnetic
force. A permanent bar magnet, a
current-carrying conductor, a
fluctuating electric field and a
moving charge can create a
magnetic field. The magnetic force __

interaction of their magnetic fields . Figure 12.1 (a): Magnetic field.
(i.e. non-contact force). SO

Michael Faraday proposed an alternative explanation. He
suggested that each magnet sets up a magnetic field in
space around it, as shown in Fig. 12.1 (a). When you place
another magnet in that field, it responds to the field at
its own location. This interaction of fields is the cause of
force between them. Interaction of field lines can be
drawn in the form of picture. As we have already
discussed in earlier classes, gravitational fields exert the
force of gravity on other masses. An electric field exists
around charges, so that other charges in this region will
experience an electric force. Similarly, magnetic fields
exert force on other magnets, like compass needles,
magnetic materials, and moving electric charges.

You can easily visualize the magnetic field of a magnet
by sprinkling iron filings near the magnet, as shown in the
Fig. 12.1 (b). The iron particles become magnetized in a
magnetic field and stick together along magnetic field Figure 12.1 (b): Magnetic field of

In 1820, Hans Oersted first described the magnetic field due to
current in a wire.

horizontal piece of card board, as shown in Fig. 12.2. Place small
magnetic compass needles on the card board along.a circle with vo 3 ks

‘When we reverse the direction of the current, the direction of B is also reversed in clockwise

direction, as shown in Fig 12.3(b). If the current through the wire is stopped, all the needles

will again point in the north-south direction. We conclude that

e A magnetic field is set up only around a current-carrying conductor.

e The lines of forces are circular, and their direction depends upon the direction of the
current.

Direction of Magnetic Field: The direction of the magnetic field can be determined by the

right-hand rule, as shown in Fig. 12.3 (c). It can be stated as:

If the wire is grasped in the fist of the right hand with the thumb pointing in the direction of

(conventional) current, then the curled fingers indicate the direction of magnetic field.

are opposite in direction. Therefore, net magnetic field is weaker there.

Therefore, a magnetic force acts on current carrying conductor from stronger towards weaker

region of magnetic field and the net magnetic field is shown in Fig 12.4 (d). Therefore, the
conductor tends to move towards the right where the net magnetic field is weak.

FLEMING'S LEFT-HAND RULE

Fleming’s Left-Hand Rule states that if we position our thumb,
forefinger, and middle finger of the left-hand mutually
perpendicular, the forefinger points towards the direction of
the magnetic field, the middle finger points towards the
direction of the electric current, then thumb indicates the
direction of the magnetic force experienced by the conductor, Figure 12.6: Flemirg’s Left-

12.3 MAGNETIC INDUCTION or MAGNETIC FLUX DENSITY

A current-carrying conductor positioned at right angle to a magnetic field will experience a
magnetic force that can be used to quantify magnetic flux density.

The formula B = i determines the flux density B for a uniform magnetic field. Where F is the

force acting on a current carrying conductor, | is the magnitude of current, and L is the length
of the conductor in the uniform magnetic field with magnetic flux density B.
The SI unit of magnetic flux density (or) magnetic induction is tesla (T).

IN
(1A)(1m)sin90°
If a 1 m-long conductor carrying a current of 1 A, placed perpendicular to a magnetic field,
experiences a force of 1 newton, then the magnetic induction is one tesla.
Another CGS unit used for B is gauss (G). The relation between tesla and gauss is

1 T = 10000 G OR 17T=10*G OR 1G=10°*T

Magnetic field is a vector quantity.

12.6 VELOCITY SELECTOR METHOD

Velocity selector is a device used as velocity filter for charged particles. It has mutually
perpendicular ‘electric and magnetic fields. When charged particle enters with velocity v
perpendicular to both electric and magnetic fields then both electric and magnetic forces act
on charged particle. Ata particular velocity the electric and magnetic force acting on charged
particle are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction cancel out their net effect and charged
particle moves in straight ig undeflected, as shown in Fig 12.12.

If the beam of charged particles, moving at different velocities, passes through the velocity
selector, only those particles will pass straight through the device, which have velocities equal
to the ratio of the electric field to the magnetic field. Particles moving slower than this speed
will be deflected in the direction of electric force because magnetic force will be less than
electric force on it. On contrary, those charge particles having greater speeds will be deflected
in the direction of magnetic force because magnetic force will be greater than electric force
on it.

The vector sum of electric and magnetic forces acting on a charged particle in electric and
magnetic fields applied in same region is called Lorentz force.

Ferrous materials are those that contain iron. The term “ferrous”
comes from the Latin word “ferrum,” which means iron. Iron can be ©
easily magnetized when placed in external magnetic fields.

In the absence of a core, the magnetic lines of forces start to diverge
by curving sharply and immediately outside the coil.

If a ferrous material (such as iron rod) is placed inside the solenoid (Fig.12.17), the strength of
the magnetic field increases significantly. This occurs because the ferrous core becomes
magnetized due to the magnetic field generated by the solenoid. This process is called
induction. If wire of solenoid is tightly wound on the iron core, then magnetic field at the cross
section remain parallel and close to each other, that’s why new magnetic field is uniform and
strong there.

The product of the magnetic flux and the number of turns of the coil. RR
It is a quantity commonly used for solenoids and coils, which are made of N turns = 5 wire.

The magnetic flux density by a single wire is usually very low.

Magnetic flux of single turn can be increased by increasing magnetic
flux density and by increasing area of loop.

The magnetic flux linkage refers to the number of turns (N) on a

The negative sign indicates that the direction
of the induced current is such that it opposes
the change in flux. Faraday’s law is the
fundamental law that describe the production
of emf due to change of magnetic flux in
various circuits and devices. For example, AC
devices like induction motors, induction
generators or transformers, as well as DC
devices like DC motors, DC generators.

Experiment 1: In this experiment, we use a
bar magnet and a coil connected to a sensitive
galvanometer, as shown in the Fig. 12.22.

--- PAGE 237 ---
ELECTROMAGNETISM re (2);

Case I: When there is no relative motion between the magnet and coil, the galvanometer shows
no current.

Case Il: When the bar magnet is moved towards the coil, the magnetic flux changes and induces
emf. As a result, induced current flows in the coil.

Case- Ill: When the bar magnet is moved away from the coil, the magnetic flux again changes,
inducing an emf and an induced current flow in the coil but in the opposite direction.

Experiment 2: Emf is Induced by relative motion
of a coil with respect to magnetic field. In this
experiment, the coil is rotated in a magnetic field.
As the change in magnetic flux is given by:
A® = AB(Acos@)

During the rotation of the coil, the angle 6 between
the magnetic field and the vector area A of the coil
changes. Therefore, the magnetic flux of the coil
changes, inducing an emf in the coil. The induced
current flows through the circuit, and which
produces deflection in the galvanometer. This is the
basic principle of an electric generator (Fig. 12.23).
Experiment 3: Emf is also Induced by changing a magnetic field (the transformer effect). In
this experiment, two coils are placed closed to each other.

The primary coil ‘P’ is connected in series with the
battery through a switch and rheostat, while the
secondary coil S is connected only to a
galvanometer. If the switch of coil P is closed, a
momentary current is induced in the coil $. When
the switch P is opened, a current is produced in the
coil S in opposite direction. When we open or close
the switch then there will be a change of current,
which causes to changing magnetic field of coil P
and the magnetic flux through coil S changes. The
changing magnetic flux induces emf in coil S, as
shown in Fig. 12.24.

If the current in the primary coil is varied with the help of a rheostat, then the magnetic field
of coil P and the magnetic flux through coil S$ change. The changing magnetic flux induces the
emf in it. The induced emf and induced current will remain in the coil as long as the magnetic
flux through it changes. This is the basic principle of the working of a transformer.

e The electromotive force, or emf is induced when the magnetic flux linking with a coil
changes (the magnetic flux either increases or decreases).

e Aconstant magnetic flux cannot produce emf in a conductor. The cause of induced emf is
a change in magnetic flux.

e The magnitude of induced emf depends on the rate of change of magnetic flux.

e The induced emf is independent of the resistance and resistivity of the circuit and depends
only on the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the conductor.

e Induced current (I = €/R ) depends on the resistance and resistivity of the circuit.

e When the magnetic flux through a conductor changes, an induced emf always produces, but
induced current only flows when the circuit is closed.

Factors Affecting the Magnitude of the Induced emf: The induced emf is affected by the
following factors:

e The induced emf depends on the number of turns in a coil.

* The induced emf depends on the speed of the movement of the conductor through the
magnetic field.

e The induced emf honoh on the length of the conductor inside the magnetic field.

e The induced emf depends on the rate of change of magnetic flux through the conductor.

e The induced emf can be increased by increasing the strength of external magnetic field.

e The induced emf can be increased by increasing the area of coil.

12.13 LENZ’S LAW

In 1834, Russian physicist Heinrich Lenz discovered that the polarity of induced emf always
leads to an induced current that opposes the change which induces the emf.

The direction of the induced current is always such as to oppose the change that causes the
current,

Condition for its application: We can apply Lenz’s law directly to closed loops because it refers
to induced currents and not induced ,
emf. However, if the loop is not closed,
we imagine it being closed, and then,
from the direction of the induced
current, we can find the polarity of the
induced emf.

Explanation: When a bar magnet is
pushed towards a coil connected to a
galvanometer then emf is induced due re :
to change in its magnetic flux and Figure 12.25 (a): The bar magnet is pushing towards
induced current flows through it, as the coil. :

shown in Fig. 12.25 (a).

Direction of current in the coil is determined by Lenz’ s law. It tells us that induced current
opposes its cause. In this experiment, cause of induced current is push of the N- pole of magnet
towards the coil (Which increases the magnetic flux through the coil). Induced current of the
coil induces such magnetic field which opposes the push of the magnet towards the coil and
hence oppose the increase of magnetic flux through the coil. It will be only possible if left side

of the coil acts as N-pole and right side acts as S-pole of a bar magnet, as shown in Fig. 12.25(a).
Now, by applying Right Hand Rule, we see that direction of current in the coil is anti-clockwise.

Similarly, if we ‘pull’ the magnet away from the coil, the induced current opposes the ‘pull’ by
creating the south pole towards the bar magnet according to Lenz’s law, as shown in Fig. 12.25
(b). When a magnet is moved away
from the coil, flux decreases through
the coil. To oppose this pull of the

magnet and decrease in magnetic flux s N
through the coil, the coil induces such

current in it that attracts the bar

magnet. For this, the left side of the current is

coil attracts the N-pole of the bar

Figure 12.25 (b): The bar magnet is pulling away from
magnet and opposes its motion. For ep coil. ° r iia:
this, direction of induced current in the
coil reverses, i.e., current flows clockwise as according to Right Hand Rule.

Lenz’s Law and Law of Conservation of Energy 2» sas

The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither |
be created nor destroyed, but it can be changed from one form to |

another.

Lenz's law states that the direction of current is such that it * =
opposes the change in the magnetic flux. So, an effort is required
to do work against opposing forces. This work leads to changes in
magnetic flux; hence, electric current is induced. Thus, mechanical
energy is converted into equivalent amount of electrical energy,
which is in accordance with the law of conservation of energy.
Let's exaplain further with the help of an example: consider that
N-pole of a magnet is approaching the coil, as shown in Fig. 12.26,
the repulsive force acts on the bar magnet due to the current
induced in the coil. The result is that the motion of the magnet
is opposed. The mechanical energy spent in overcoming this
opposition is converted into electrical energy, which appears
in the coil. We have to spend mechanical energy to induce
electrical energy. Thus, Lenz's law is in accordance with the
law of conservation of energy.

Fleming’s Right Hand Rule: To find the direction of the
induced current, Fleming’s right-hand rule may be used, as aan —
shown in Fig. 12.27. It is stated as: e 12.27: Fleming's right-

IN ELECTROMAGNETISM

if the forefinger points in the direction of magnetic field, thumb in the direction of motion of
the conductor, then the middle finger will point in the direction of induced current. Ae
When the conductor moves upwards at right angle to a stationary magnetic field then the
direction of induced current is from right to left. If the motion of the conductor is downward,
then the direction of induced current will be from left to right.

ELECTROMAGNETISM

tN

When the Earth vibrates due to earthquake, there is relative motion between magnet and the
coil. This causes change in magnetic flux through the coil. It induces emf and current in the
coil according to Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction. This induced current is given to
external circuit where values are recorded and graph is plotted.

During a high-intensity earthquake, the relative velocity between the coil and magnet
increases, and the amplitude of the vibration of the coil increases.

The induced emf in the coil is directly proportional to the displacement of the coil within the
magnetic field.

When the coil moves faster, the rate of change of displacement of the coil in a magnetic field
increase; as a result, the rate of change of magnetic flux of the coil increases, and induced emf
increases.

SUMMARY...

* The force on a charge moving inside a magnetic field result from interaction between the
magnetic field produced by the moving charge (which is equivalent to current) and the
applied magnetic field.

* When a charge moves in magnetic field in circular path, its speed and K.E remain same but
its velocity and momentum change due to change in direction of motion

* For a point on the axis of a circular coil carrying current, magnetic field is maximum at the
centre of the coil.

* The magnetic field is the region or space surrounding a magnet in which a compass needle,
a small magnet, another ferromagnetic material, and a moving charged particle experiences
a magnetic force.

* Magnetic flux linkage is defined as the product of the magnetic flux and the number of turns
of the coil.

* Faraday’s law states that ‘the magnitude of induced e.m.f. is directly proportional to the
rate of change of magnetic flux linking the coil and the number of turns of the coil N.

* Lenz’s Law states that the direction of the induced current is always such as to oppose the
change that causes the current.

RELATIVITY ¥ (ED!
Pap _.<e®

Albert Einstein's theory of relativity transformed the theoretical physics and astronomy during
the 20th century by superseding a 200-years-old theory of mechanics created by Isaac
Newton. The ideas behind relativity might seem mysterious, as they introduced new concepts
such as four-dimensional spacetime, relativity of simultaneity, time dilation, and length
contraction.

The theory of relativity, given by Albert Einstein, includes two theories: special relativity and
general relativity. Albert Einstein published special theory of relativity and general theory of
relativity in 1905 and 1915, respectively. Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena
in the absence of gravity. General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to
the forces of nature. Einstein explained the situations in which Newtonian physics might fail to
deal successfully with phenomena, and in doing so proposed revolutionary changes in human
concepts of time, space and gravity.

Over the last century, many experiments have confirmed the validity of both special relativity
and general relativity. It includes the observation that light deflect from distant stars as the
starlight passed by our sun, proving that gravity distort or curve space. Instead of being an
invisible force that attracts objects to one another, gravity is a curving or warping of space.
The more massive an object, the more it warps the space around it, as shown in the cover
picture of this unit.

The special theory of relativity became an important and necessary tool in the new fields
of nuclear physics, atomic physics and quantum mechanics. Nuclear power plants and nuclear
weapons etc., would be impossible without the knowledge that matter can be transformed into
energy. So, the theory has an enormous impact on the modern world. In this unit, we shall
discuss some important aspects of special relativity.

13.1 FRAME OF REFERENCE

A frame of reference is a coordinate system that can Safiipa to determine oeness and
velocities of objects with in that frame,

i

For example, when a ball rolls in a street, you can say that the ball is moving because the frame
of reference is the streets, whatever may be on the side of the street or the Earth itself. The
origin, orientation and scale of a reference frame are specified by a set of geometric points
whose positions are identified both mathematically and physically. All measurements of motion
are made relative compared to a frame of reference. Different v

frames of reference can move relative to one another.

Consider two persons A and B are seated in a bus and the bus is

moving with a velocity v, as shown in Fig. 13.1. If we ask to A

about the velocity of B, he will say that B is at rest. But if we ask =n au on ve

RELATIVITY

Frame of reference are of two types: Inertial frame of reference and non-inertial frame of
reference.

Inertial Reference Frame

An inertial reference frame is a frame of reference in which Newton's law holds true: i.e., an
object at rest remains at rest, and object in motion remains in motion with a constant velocity
on a straight line, unless acted upon by an external force.

A frame of reference that is at rest or moving with a uniform velocity along a straight line is
called an inertial frame of reference.

An inertial frame of reference does not accelerate. Any reference frame that moves with
constant velocity relative to an inertial frame is itself inertial. The Earth can be considered an
inertial reference frame for many experiments. The interior of a car moving along a road at
constant velocity and the interior of a stationary house are examples of inertial reference
frames.

Non-inertial Reference Frame

In a non-inertial frame of reference, objects experience acceleration even in the absence of
applied forces because the reference frame itself is accelerating relative to an inertial frame.
Newton's laws do not hold in a non-inertial frame of reference.

‘A frame of reference that is accelerating is called a non-inertial frame of reference.

An accelerating car is example of non-inertial reference frame.

13.2 SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY

a

in 1905, Albert Einstein introduced his famous theory of |
relativity. This theory deals with the structure of space-time. Albert Eirstein
Einstein’s special theory of relativity is based on two postulates: |, (18749-1955)

1) The Principle of Relativity

The laws of physics are the same for all observers in any inertial —
frames of reference. As long as an object is moving in a straight
line at a constant speed (i.e., with zero acceleration), the laws
of physics are the same for every observer.

This implies that the experiments performed in stationary and

rwwving inertial frames of reference yield the same results. For born theoretical physicist. a
example, it is impossible to determine experimentally whether wee of 4¥ greatest ee

an inertial reference frame is stationary or moving without time,
observing it from an external frame of reference.

eee

v.

Consider two individuals; one standing in a stationary train and the other is standing in a train
moving at constant velocity v, as shown in Fig. 13.2. Both are observing the free fall motion of
a ball under the action of —

Stationary train Moving train

reikipai falling ball under the action of gravity in inertial frame.

Both the individuals are in inertial frames of reference, where Newton’s laws apply equally for
both of them. Both persons will observe the ball falling in a vertical path. If the trains are
windowless, the passengers will have no way of knowing whether their train is stationary or
moving at constant velocity.

2) The Principle of the Constancy of the Speed of Light

The speed of light in vacuum is always constant for all observers, regardless of the relative
velocity between the source of light and the observer measuring it. No matter how fast an
observer or the light source is moving, measured speed of light (c) always yields the same value
i.e., ¢ = 299,792,458 ms".

This postulate has profound implications, particularly as it contradicts Newtonian mechanics.
For instant, you were travelling at 0.5c in the same direction as the beam of light, Newtonian
mechanics predicts that you would observe the speed of the light beam to be 0.5c. However,
according to special relativity, you would still observe the speed of light to be at c. This leads
to a range of fascinating effects.

When a stationary person measures the speed of light emitted from a train at rest, the speed
is simply c. However, the speed of light remains c even when the train is moving relative to the
Pane, as shown in the Fig. 13.3 ().

If a person travelling on this moving train looks into -..... wa

(b). Will this person see a reflection of themselves

Newtonian Physics suggests that no reflection would — . J *

person to a mirror and returns to the person's eyes.

When Newtonian relativity is applied to this thought c—_—

light from the person and the mirror is zero. This nee aaa

implies the light will never reach the mirror and thus person would not see a reflection.

However, this outcome contradicts the first postulate of special relativity which states that a
person in an inertial frame of reference, such as this one, will not be able to identify whether
the frame of reference is stationary or moving at a constant speed. If the person cannot see
their reflection in the mirror, it would suggest that the train must not be stationary, as a
reflection would be visible if were the case.

Special relativity, however, asserts that a reflection is indeed seen. The contradiction derived
from Newtonian mechanics in this thought experiment supports the constancy of light's speed.
The second postulate of special relativity states that light’s speed is constant in a vacuum for
all inertial frames of reference. This means that from the perspective of the person and mirror
in the moving train, light's relative velocity is still c. as a result, the light will reach the mirror
and be reflected back to the person's eyes. Therefore, the person will see a reflection of
themselves in the mirror.

13.3 CONSEQUENCES OF THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY

There are other surprising consequences of the special theory of relativity. These consequences
of the special theory of relativity are summarized in the following.

Relativity of simultaneity

Two events that are simultaneous for one observer, may not be simultaneous for another
observer in relative motion. For example, consider a person is standing next to a train track
and comparing observations of a lightning storm with a person inside a moving train. The train
is moving at nearly the speed of light.

Einstein imagined scenario when the train is positioned at a point on the track equally between
two trees. If a bolt of lightning strikes both trees at the same time, the person standing beside
the track would receive the strike as simultaneous. However, because the person inside the
train is moving toward one lightning bolt and away from the other, the person on the moving

train would see the bolt ahead of the train first, and the bolt behind the train later.

--- PAGE 251 ---
"RELATIVITY aoe

a5 ae

Einstein concluded that simultaneity is not absolute. In other words, events that appears
simultaneous to one observer may occur at different times for another observer. He realized
that it is not light speed that changes, but time itself that is relative. Time moves differently
for objects in motion compared to those at rest. However, the speed of light remains constant
and is observed to be the same by anyone, anywhere in the universe, regardless of their
motion.

Mass-Energy Equivalence

sil and mass are mRPLSN 9 and cance expcegen we the eee

enare E is ene, _m stands for mass iad c for the mens: of light. Many canes sbiatved
that the object’s mass increases with the velocity but never knew how to calculate it. This
equation is the answer to their problem, which explains that the increased relativistic weight
of the object is equal to the kinetic energy divided by the square of the speed of light. As, the
speed of light is too high, ‘50 a tiny amount of mass is equivalent to a very large amount of

energy. That’s why atomic and b rogen bombs are so powerful. The concept of mass defect |
in atomic nucleus is also justifie ‘bythe expression of mass-energy equivalence. |

Length Contraction

Objects appear shorter in the direction of their motion relative to the observer. The length of
an object measured in its rest frame is called the proper length (L.). Other observers in
different reference frames, which are in relative motion will always measure the length (L) to
be shorter. This scoala anata is described by tne ohxing equation:

This effect, known as length centvection occurs sa « dicey of m NOea
Time Dilation

One of the key consequences of Einstein's special relativity is” hed time is experienced
differently by moving objects. An object in motion undergoes time dilation, meaning that it
experiences time more slowly compared to when it is at rest. Moving clocks are observed to
tick more slowly than clocks that are stationary from the observer’s perspective.

The time taken for an event to occur within its rest frame is called proper time (t.). Observers
in different reference frames in a relative motion will always measure the lapsed time taken
(t) to be longer. This is expressed by the equation:

roa (13.3)

251

Tip RELATIVITY

Mass Variation

The mass of a moving object increases as its velocity increases. This phenomenon is known as
mass variation, is another expression of mass-energy equivalence. It is represented
mathematically as:

(13.4)

Where, m is the relativistic mass, m, is the rest mass of particle, c is the speed of light and v
is the velocity of the particle relative to a stationary observer.

This effect becomes noticeable only at relativistic speeds (speed close to the speed of light).
As an object is accelerated closer to the speed of light, its mass increases. The more massive
it becomes, the more energy is required to achieve the same acceleration, making further
acceleration more and more difficult. The energy that is put into attempting acceleration is
instead converted into mass. The total energy of an object is kinetic energy plus the energy
embodied in its mass. To accelerate even the smallest object to the speed of light would require
an infinite amount of energy. Therefore, material objects are restricted to speeds less than the
speed of light.

Example 13.1: If a 0.5 kg body is moving at a speed of equivalent to 90 % of the speed of
light. What will be its mass in this situation?

Given: v = 90 of c = 0.9¢ Mo = 0.5 kg

To Find: m=?

Solution: Using the relation: m= —ate

Putting values, we get: m= aa = 1.15 kg

is 1.6731 0-27 kg. y

13.4 TIME ASA FOURTH DIMENSION IN THE SPACETIME MODEL

Until the 20th century, it was thought that |—
the three-dimensional geometry of the \
universe (its description in terms of
locations, shapes, distances, and directions) —
was distinct from time (the measurement of
when events occur within the universe).
However, according to Einstein, you need to
describe the location of an object not only |
in three-dimensional space (length, width _
and height) but also in time. Hence time is |
the fourth dimension.

To know where you are, you have to know
what time it is. The history of an object's
location through time traces out a line or |
curve on a spacetime diagram. Each point in _
a spacetime diagram represents a unique
position in space and time.

Spacetime is a mathematical model, as shown in the Fig. 13.4, that unites the three dimensions
of space with the single dimension of time into a single four-dimensional continuum. Spacetime
diagrams are useful in visualizing and understanding relativistic effects such as how different
observers perceive where and when events

occur. = For Your information

PARTICLE PHYSICS

From the beginning of time, humans have had an innate urge to discover the mysteries of the
universe. In other quest to find the fundamental building block of the cosmos, they have
unlocked many doors to scientific knowledge.

Particle physics, also known as high-energy physics, is a. branch of physics that deals with
fundamental constituents of matter and radiation, and their interactions. It delves into the
nature of subatomic particles, such as quarks, leptons, bosons, and their respective forces. The
Standard Model of particle physics describes these particles and their interactions, excluding
gravity. This field of physics aims to understand the universe at the smallest scales and highest
energies.

Today, particle physics experiments are often conducted at large facilities such as the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC), where particles are accelerated to high energies and collided, allowing
physicists to probe the fundamental structure of the universe.

14.1 CONSERVATION LAWS IN NUCLEAR REACTIONS

Charge and nucleon cons vilithe are fundamental principles in nuclear processes, deeply
rooted in the laws of physics and the interactions among subatomic particles. These
conservation laws play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of atomic nuclei and ensuring
that the fundamental properties of matter are preserved during nuclear reactions and decays.

14.1.1 Conservation of Charge

The conservation of charge is a fundamental property of particle interactions. In any closed
system, the total charge before and after an interaction or decay must remain the same.
Consider the example of a-decay:

~~

wRa?—+ Rn”? + 2He* + Q K Pe sienebeice

Here in this reaction, total charge on L.H.S is equal to the total — on R. H. 1S. This is Locus
charge is a conserved quantity i.e. it cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be transferred
from one particle to another. In nuclear processes, the charges of the particles involved (such
as protons, electrons, positrons) are carefully balanced to maintain overall charge neutrality.
14.1.2 Conservation of Nucleons

Nucleons, comprising both protons and neutrons, are the building blocks of atomic nuclei. The
conservation of nucleons refers to the principle that the total number of nucleons remains
constant before and after a nuclear reaction or decay. Consider the cabs nuclear reaction

7N‘* + 2He* —+ 0+ ,H'+Q : Res Sieh ee!
The number of nucleons on the L.H.S = 14 + 4 = 18
The number of nucleons on the R.H.S = 17 + 1 = 18

Hence, total number of nucleons on both the sides are same, i.e., 18. This conservation law is

a consequence of the strong nuclear force, that binds nucleons together in the nucleus. The
strong force is a short-range force that acts between quarks (the constituents of protons and

258

--- PAGE 259 ---
PARTICLE PHYSICS A 7

a>

neutrons), ensuring that the nucleons are not spontaneously created or destroyed during
nuclear processes.

The conservation of charge and nucleons is upheld in various nuclear reactions, such as alpha
decay, beta decay, and fusion reactions. These laws have been extensively tz ‘cu and
confirmed through experiments and observations in particle physics and nuclear science. They
provide a deep insight into the underlying symmetries and interactions within the subatomic
world and have far-reaching implications for understanding the behavior of matter ‘at the
smallest scales.

Alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays are three types of radiation commonly
associated with radioactive decay processes. These particles and rays have distinct properties
regarding mass and charge:

1) Alpha Particle:

Composition: An alpha particle consists of two protons and two neutrons, which are bound
together as a single entity.

Mass: The total mass of an alpha particle is approximately 4 atomic mass units (u) or unified
atomic mass units (u), equivalent to about 6.64 x 10’ kilograms.

Charge: Alpha particles carry a positive charge of +2e, where "e" represents the elementary
charge. This charge corresponds to twice the charge of a single proton.

2) Beta Particle: ‘ :

Composition: Beta particles are high-energy electrons (8°) or positrons (beta-plus) emitted
during certain types of radioactive decay.

Mass: B-particles have a much smaller mass than a-particles. Electrons have a mass of
approximately 9.11 x 10°" kg, while positrons have the same mass but with a positive charge.
Charge: 8° particles (electrons) carry a negative charge of -1e. 8° particles (positrons) carry a
positive charge of +1e, where e = 1.6x10° C.

3) Gamma Ray: ;

Composition: Gamma rays are electromagnetic waves, similar to X-rays. They do not consist of
particles in the traditional sense.

Mass: Gamma rays have no mass because they are composed of photons, which are massless
particles. _

Charge: Gamma rays are electrically neutral, meaning they carry no electric charge.

These differences in mass and charge are essential for understanding their behavior,
interactions, and effects in various contexts, including radioactivity and radiation protection.

14.2 PARTICLE’S DECAYS .
ae Se eee ee ee ee
Antiparticles are a unique concept in particle physics, representing the counterparts to regular
particles. They share the same mass as their corresponding particles but have opposite electric
charges. This phenomenon is a consequence of the symmetries in the fundamental laws of
physics. Here are a couple of examples to illustrate this concept:

259

Cee

--- PAGE 260 ---
» SUSTRZE particte prysics

Electron-Positron:

Electron: An electron is a subatomic particle with a negative electric charge of -1e and a mass
of approximately 9.11 x 10°" kg.

Positron: The positron is the antiparticle counterpart of the electron. It has the same mass as
an electron (approximately 9.11 x 10°’ kg) but carries a positive electric charge of +1e. This
pairing of electron and positron is an example of matter-antimatter annihilation. When an
electron and a positron collide, they annihilate each other, converting their masses into energy
in the form of gamma rays. This process is known as matter-antimatter annihilation.
Proton-Antiproton:

Proton: A proton is a subatomic particle found in the nucleus of an atom. It carries a positive
electric charge of +1e and has a mass of approximately 1.67 x 107? kg.

Antiproton: The antiproton is the antiparticle counterpart of the proton. It shares the same
mass as a proton (approximately 1.67 x 10?” kg) but carries a negative electric charge of -1e.
Antiprotons can be produced artificially in high-energy particle accelerators and are used in
scientific experiments to study the fundamental properties of matter.

These examples highlight the principle of charge conservation in particle-antiparticle pairs,
where the total charge remains conserved while exhibiting opposite signs. Additionally, the
conservation of mass is also evident as the masses of particles and their corresponding
antiparticles are identical.

14.2.1 Alpha Decays
In alpha decay, atomic number of the parent nucleus reduces by 2 and the mass number reduces
by 4 units. The decay product is called the daughter nucleus. The daughter nucleus may also
remain unstable and undergo further disintegration till it attains stability. Alpha decay of asRa””®
is shown below:

Q is the disintegration energy, which is always positive (as the process is spontaneous).

14.2.2 Beta Decays

»
Beta-minus (B-) decay and beta-plus (B+) decay are two types of radioactive decay processes
involving the emission of beta particles. These processes occur in atomic nuclei to achieve a
more stable nuclear configuration. Here's how each process works:

In beta-minus decay, a neutron (n) within the nucleus is transformed into a proton (p), an
electron (beta-minus particle # ), and an antineutrino (ve). The antineutrino is a nearly

massless, electrically neutral particle that carries away some of the energy released during the
decay. The emitted beta-minus particle is an electron. The process can be summarized as
follows:

n=p* +B +Ve (14.1)

260

--- PAGE 261 ---
PARTICLE PHYSICS 4):

May ed
The newly formed proton remains in the nucleus, increasing the atomic number by 1, while
beta-minus particle and antineutrino are emitted from the nucleus.
In beta-plus decay, a proton within the nucleus is transformed into a neutron (n), a positron
(beta-plus particle f° ), anda neutrino (v,). The emitted beta-plus particle is a positron, which
is the antiparticle of an electron. The process can be summarized as follows:

p’ =n+B +v, (14.2)

The newly formed neutron remains in the nucleus, reducing the atomic number by 1, while
beta-plus particle and neutrino are emitted from the nucleus. Both beta minus and beta plus
decay processes are governed by the weak nuclear force, one of the fundamental forces in
nature responsible for mediating certain types of particle interactions. These processes play a
crucial role in the overall stability and transformation of atomic nuclei, allowing them to
achieve more balanced configurations and release excess energy.

14.2.3 Energies for Alpha and Beta Decay

Alpha and beta particles are products of radioactive decay processes, and they carry different
amounts of energy due to their distinct properties and mechanisms of emission.

Alpha particles have discrete energies in nuclear processes due to the specific nature of the
quantum mechanical interactions within atomic nuclei. These energies are determined by the
energy levels and quantum states of the particles within the nucleus, as well as the binding
forces that hold the nucleus together. Inside a nucleus, protons and neutrons are arranged in
energy levels or shells, similar to how electrons are arranged in energy levels around an atom’s
nucleus. These energy levels are quantized, meaning they can only take a certain discrete
value. When an alpha particle is formed during radioactive decay, it involves the rearrangement
of nucleons within the nucleus, which results in specific energy changes.

Quantization of Energy Levels: Just as electrons in an atom can only exist only at certain
discrete energy levels, nucleons within a nucleus also occupy quantized energy levels. When
nucleons rearrange themselves to form an alpha particle, the energy change corresponds to the
difference between the initial and final energy states.

Binding Energies: The formation of an alpha particle involves the strong nuclear force, which
binds nucleons together in the nucleus. As nucleons combine to form an alpha particle, changes
occur in the binding energies of the particles involved. These changes result in the release of
energy, which is carried away by the alpha particle.

Conservation of Energy: The conservation of energy is a principle in all physical processes.
The total energy of the system before and after the alpha particle emission must be conserved.
This conservation leads to the emission of alpha particles with specific, well-defined energies.
Consequently, the energies of alpha particles emitted in nuclear processes are quantized and
discrete. These specific energy levels of alpha particles provide valuable information about the
structure of atomic nuclei, the binding forces involved, and the dynamics of nuclear reactions.

PARTICLE PHYSICS

Energy of beta particles: The continuous energies spectrum of beta particles in nuclear
processes can be attributed to the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, along with the
conservation of energy and momentum. Unlike alpha particles, which have discrete energies,
the energies of beta particles are spread out over a range of values. This continuous energy
spectrum arises from several factors:

i) Quantum Uncertainty: In quantum mechanics, particles are described by wave functions
that exhibit inherent uncertainty in certain properties, including energy. This uncertainty
allows for a range of possible energies for a given particle. When a beta particle is emitted
during a nuclear decay, its specific energy is not predetermined but subject to quantum
uncertainty.

ii) Neutrinos in Beta Decay: In beta decay processes, such as beta-minus (B-) and beta-plus
(B+) decay, an additional particle is involved: the neutrino or antineutrino. These particles are
extremely lightweight and have negligible mass, which means they carry away some of the
energy released during the decay, This leads to a spread of energies in the emitted beta
particles, as the neutrinos can ws varying, amounts of energy, leaving less for the beta
particles.

iii) Conservation Laws: While the total energy before and after beta decay must be
conserved, there is flexibility in how that energy is distributed between the emitted beta
particle and the accompanying neutrino. This flexibility results in a continuum of possible
energy values for the beta particles.

iv) Final State Interactions: In some cases, the emitted beta particles can interact with
other particles or fields as they travel through matter. These interactions can affect the energy
and momentum of the beta particles, contributing to the continuous energy spectrum observed
in experiments.

14.3 MATTER AND ANTI-MATTER |

Peta Bb each see aera ei Tip TF SSIS oe tk Ne
in 1928, a British physicist Paul Dirac, while studying the behavior of electrons at very high
speeds (speeds comparable to light) derived an equation for the energy of an electron by
combining special relativity and quantum theory. Generally, the relationship for the energy and
momentum of a particle can be expressed as:
E= Nd (14.2) BL,

2m

Solving this relation for relativistic speed by using ‘special ‘relativity ard quantum theory, he
derived an equation which can be given as:

se +f m? c‘ +p’ c (14. 4)

Here ‘E’ is the energy ‘of the particle, ‘m’ is the mass, ‘p’ is the momentum and ‘c’ is the speed
of light. Positive and negative solutions for energy give a striking idea for anti-particles.

PARTICLE PHYSICS

If positive solution of the Dirac’s equation is for electron (the
particle) then negative solution for energy must be for a particle
which should have mass and momentum equal to that of electron
but of opposite charge and magnetic moment. Dirac said this
energy solution is for positron (the anti-particle of electron). The
energy cones for electron and positron are shown in Fig. 14.1. Soon
after the prediction of Dirac on solving his equation for the
existence of anti-particles, James Anderson discovered the
positron. In 1932, while studying the tracks of cosmic ray particles
in a cloud chamber at California institute of technology, he
discovered a particle which has the mass equal to the mass of an

was the first experimental discovery of an anti-particle. After that a lot of anti-particles were
discovered. Electron, proton and neutron along with their respective anti-particles are listed

here in table 14.1.

Particles are divided into two groups depending upon their spins. Particles with integer spins

Anti-matter and Medical Technology
Antimatter is used in the medical technology, for

example, anti-protons are used to treat some types of
cancers, positrons are used in positron emission
topography (PET scan) to create images of internal
body part. In this process positrons are emitted by the
decay of radio nuclei. Photons are produced when
positrons collide with electrons, converting the
electron-positron pair into energy. Scanner detects
the annihilated photons at ai) arigie of 180° apart from
each other. Using these photons an image of the
internal body is obtained. PET scan is used to evaluate
organs like the heart and brain and are also used for
detection and evaluation of cancers.

14.3.1 Asymmetry of Matter and Anti-matter

Particle and anti-particles mirror each other almost perfectly; for every particle in the universe,

there ought to be a particle of anti-matter. Our Earth, the Sun and the dust between the
galaxies are made up of normal matter. It looks like the whole universe is made up of matter,
so when we look around, we don’t see any anti-matter, why? The asymmetry in the universe is
essential for the existence of stars and even life itself. Hence asymmetry is good thing in itself.

A particle and anti-particle are charge conjugate of each

other (i.e., a positive and negative pair), hence whenever in puwoh,
any reaction, a pair of particle and anti-particle is made law Qari”
of conservation of charge requires this conjugation, which is
known as C-symmetry. Also, the particle and anti-particle
are like ‘mirrors’ to each other, as the inversion of nuclear
spatial coordinates; the state of being equal with reference
to some coordinate is called ‘parity’ (the space inversion).
Collectively, charge conjugation and parity are called CP-
symmetry. A simple depiction of charge ety and parity
is shown in Fig. 14.3. Figure 14.3: A simple depiction

of C-symmetry and P-symmetry
Then why the anti-matter is so rare if the matter and anti-
matter are perfectly balanced. What happened to the anti-matter stuff? The answer lies to the
early universe.

The most accepted theory about the creation of universe is the big bang theory. According to
this theory, about 13.7 billion years ago an explosion took place with creation of matter and
antimatter in perfectly equal amount with CP-symmetry. But with this symmetry all the matter
would annihilate leaving behind an empty universe. But the real universe has the excess matter
which formed by surviving this annihilation, is due to CP-violation.

CP-violation is a phenomenon where the same CO mina Ree Aen *S TUe

decay process has a different probability for a a —
e particle than for an anti-particle.

in particle physics, it is the violation of the
combined conservation laws i.e. charge
conjugation and parity by the weak force. The
CP-violation seems to be the main cause of this
asymmetry in the universe. In early universe,
equal amount of matter and anti-matter were

produced, but after first second when nuclei Sot genes ueverne — cee

weak force responsible for the nuclear decays, both violate the CP. Evidences in early universe
for strong force’s CP-violation are less as compare to the weak force.

14.4 QUARKS

In the early 20" century, protons and neutrons were considered as elementary particles.
However, in 1964 Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig independently proposed the quark
theory, which described the protons and neutrons as being composed of quarks. The existence
of quark was first confirmed in a deep inelastic scattering experiment at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) in 1968.

Elementary particles are those particles which are not composed of the other particles.
Elementary particles in the universe can be broadly categorized mainly into two groups i.e.,
the matter particles (fermions with half integer spin) and force carriers (bosons with integer
spin). Similar to the periodic table of elements, elementary particles are arranged in a table
known as the Standard Model of elementary particles, as shown in Fig. 14.5.

The first part of matter particles inthe table Standard Model of Elementary Particles
is quarks, which have a size of roughly 10:"* m. niiabiaians peated

Quarks are elementary particles and basic — Wermions) (bosons)
building blocks of meson and baryons, the |
main constituent of all the matter. Each quark
has a corresponding anti-quark with same
properties but opposite charge. These quarks
combine to form composite particles called
hadrons. Quarks can be divided into six flavors
(flavors are some properties of the particles)
i.e. up, down, charm, strange, top and
bottom. All the quarks have half spin (1/2).

1. Up Quark: These are the lightest among all
the quarks that is why they are the most
stable among all the six quark flavors.
Their mass ranges from 1.7-3.1 MeV/c? and
has a charge of +2/3e (two-third of charge
of an electron). They are denoted by ‘u’

and anti-up quark is denoted by ‘nu’. It is first generation quark.

Down Quark: These are heavy than the up quark but lighter than rest of all quarks. Due to

small mass, they are highly stable particles. Their mass ranges from 4.1-5.7 MeV/c? and

their charge is one-third of that of an electron (-1/3 e). They are denoted by ‘d’ and their
counterpart anti-down is denoted by ‘ d’. It is first generation quark.

3. Charm Quark: These quarks have a mass about 1280 MeV/c?. It is hundreds of times more
massive than the up and down quarks. It is the second generation of quarks. They have a
charge +2/3e. It is denoted by ‘c’ and its anti-charm quark is denoted by ‘c’.

4. Strange Quark: These quarks have a mass about 96 MeV/ c?. It is the second generation of
quarks. They have a charge -1/3e. It is denoted by ‘s’ and its anti-strange quark is denoted

by ‘s’. They have very long life even they can live 100,000 times longer than the similar
particles.

5. Top Quark: These quarks are the heaviest among all the quarks and have a mass about
173.1 GeV/c?. It is the third generation of quarks. They have a charge +2/3e. It is denoted

by ‘t’ and its anti-top quark is denoted by ‘7’. It is not a stable particle even it decays
before it has an opportunity to form hadronic bound states.

6. Bottom Quark: These quarks have a mass about 4.18 GeV/c’. It is the third generation of
quarks. They have a charge -1/3e. It is denoted
by ‘b’ and its anti-bottom quark is denoted by | |

‘b’. Bottom quark decays mostly into a charm
quark but rarely into an up quark.

The quarks are shown in figure 14.6. Another
property of quarks and gluons is the color charge,
which is related to particle’s strong interaction in
the theory of quantum chromo dynamics (QCD).
Quantum chromo dynamics is the model which
governs the behavior of quarks. This color property
is totally different from common meanings of color  e
in everyday life. Quarks can be found in three © Figure 14.6: The quarks.
color charges i.e. the red, the blue and the green | ee ee
along with the three anti color quarks i.e. the anti-red, the anti-blue and the anti-green.

14.4.1 Hadrons:

The subatomic particles which are made up of quarks and anti-quarks held together by the
strong force with the help of gluons are called hadrons. They are the heaviest particles. As we
studied that quarks have fractional charges, but hadrons which are made up of quarks have
integer charges.

Some examples of hadrons include kaons, protons, neutrons, anti-protons and anti-neutrons.
Hadrons experience strong nuclear force. Properties of hadrons are as follow:

¢ Hadrons are unstable particles and they can decay. Only hadron which is stable even in free-
state is the proton while the neutron is stable only within the nucleus. x

Due to participating quarks, hadrons are mainly divided into two groups i.e. baryons and

mesons.

1. Baryons: Those particles which are approximately equal in mass to that of a proton or
greater are called baryon. These hadrons are made up of three quarks and are classified as
fermions, as they have half integer spin due to the odd number of quarks. Proton and
neutron are well known baryons. A quantum number which is equal to the number of baryons -
minus the number of anti-baryons in a system of subatomic Particles is called ‘baryon

14.4.2 Composition of Proton and Neutron

Protons and neutrons are made up of quarks. A proton is made up of two up quarks aid one
down quark. As we know that up quark has a charge of (+2/3)e and down quark has a charge of
(-1/3)e. By adding the charge of these three quarks we get +1e charge for a proton, i.e., (+2/3
+2/3-1/3 = +1). Similarly, the anti-proton consists of the anti-quarks of the same type. A proton
in terms of color charge consists of a blue-up, a red-up and a green-down quark. The
composition of both proton and the neutron along with type and color charge is shown in Fig.

Similarly, a neutron is made up of two
down quarks and one up quark. Both down
quarks have a charge of (-1/3)e and one up
quark have a charge of (+2/3)e. By adding
the charge of these three quarks we get
‘0’ charge for a neutron, i.e. (+2/3 -1/3 -
1/3 = 0). Similarly, the anti-neutron
consists of the anti-quarks of the same
type. A neutron in terms of color charge
consists of a blue-down, a red-down and a
green-up quark. The composition of both
the proton and the neutron, along with
their counter anti-particles i.e., the anti-proton
and the anti-neutron is shown in Fig. 14.9.

In electromagnetic force, charge is the basic property
that allows a particle to experience this force.
Neutral particles cannot experience the
electromagnetic force. Similarly, in the strong
interactions of the strong nuclear force (color force),
color is the basic property of a particle to experience
this force. A colorless particle cannot feel ae strong a

14.4.3 Change in Quarks during Beta Decays
As we have studied in topic 14.2.1 that whenever a proton decays into a neutron or a neutron

decay into a proton, these processes are called beta decay. We now need to study how quarks
change their types during these decays.

1) Beta-positive Decay: In this decay, a proton is converted into a neutron, a positron ( 8*)
and a neutrino. This decay can be represented by equation 14.2, as:

+ +
p’ =n+e'+v,

In above relation, only two particles are made up of quarks i.e. the proton and the neutron. A
proton consists of two up-quarks and one down-quark, while a neutron consists of two down-
quarks and one up-quark. So, in this reaction one of the up-quark turns into a down-quark with
production of weak boson W’, which is very short lived and soon decays into a positron and a

neutrino due to the weak interaction. Beta positive decay, when an up-quark turns into a down-
quark is shown in Fig. 14.10.

2) Beta-negative decay: Jn this decay, a neutron is converted into a proton, an electron (7 ),
and an anti-neutrino. This decay is given by equation 14.1, as:

In above relation, only two particles are made up of quarks i.e., the proton and the neutron. A
neutron consists of two down-quarks and one up-quark, while proton consists of two up-quarks
and one down-quark. In this reaction one of the down-quark turns into an up-quark with
production of a weak boson W’, which is very short-lived and soon decays into an electron and
an anti-neutrino due to the weak interaction. Beta negative decay, where a down-quark turns
into an up-quark, is shown in Fig. 14.11. ,

second group of matter particles is lepton.

leptons. Leptons cannot be found within nucleus or nucleons; rather if they produced in

14.5.1 Conservation Laws of Lepton and Baryon

Like conservation laws of mass, energy, momentum and charge in physics, we need some other
conservation laws like the lepton-number conservation and the baryon-number conservation.
Every particle interaction should necessary be according to these laws of conservations. The
interaction which is not satisfying any of these laws cannot take place in real world. The law

Point To Ponder
Hideki Yukawa introduced the quantum idea of fields (which is studied in
quantum field theory QFT). He proposed that the nuclear forces are
transmitted by the exchange of particles called “mediators or carrier
particles”. Later, we found carrier particles for all natural forces. A
fermion (matter particle) produces a boson (force carrier) which is
absorbed by another fermion to exert force on each other. The interaction
between two approaching protons’ repulsion by exchanging a photon (force
carrier for electromagnetic interaction) is shown’ here by the Feynman

diagram.
14.6 FORCE CARRIERS
In standard model of particle, there is a group of particles which imeraetions | fore carriers

do not make the matter but they are responsible for binding
matter together. The interactions between matter-particles are
mainly due to four types of fundamental forces i.e. the strong
nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, the electromagnetic
force and the gravitational force. Each force interacts through
the exchange of particles called ‘force carriers’ or ‘mediators’.
The force carriers, are shown in Fig. 14.13, and are given in
detailed below.

14.6.1 The Photon

In interactions involving electromagnetic force, the exchange
particle is photon. A photon is the smallest quantum of
electromagnetic radiation and is the basic unit of light. Photons
can travel through vacuum with a speed of 3x10° ms". According
to Max Planck, the energy of photon is the product of its Figure 14.13: Force

Photons have zero rest mass energy; they exist only as moving
particles. They are neutral and stable particles. They have a spin
of ‘1’ hence belong to the boson family. They are also
elementary particles which have energy, momentum and
frequency of oscillations. According to quantum field theory,
they are exchanged between the charged particles when they
exert electromagnetic force on each other. Hence, they are the
mediators of electromagnetic force, as shown in Fig. 14.14,

14.6.2 The Giuon

A particle that is exchanged between quarks to bind them
together to form particles like protons and neutrons is called
gluon.

Gluons are massless particles, travel at the speed of light and
are vector boson, meaning they have a spin of 1. They are the
exchange particles for the color force (the strong nuclear
force). Like quarks, gluons also exhibit the property of color.
During strong interactions, one quark or anti-quark emits a
gluon and other anti-quark or quark absorbs the gluon; hence
they are called the quanta of strong force. The gluons are
capable of exchanging color for conservation of color charge... Figure 14.15: exchange of
They have no electric charge. The exchange of a gluon — on between two quarks.
between two quarks is shown in Fig. 14.15.

14.6.3 The Z-Boson

Z-boson was discovered in 1983 at CERN. Z-boson is electrically neutral and has its own anti-
particle. It has a mass of 91.19 GeV/c’, which is nearly hundred times that of the proton, making
it one of the heaviest elementary particles. Bosons are very short-lived particles, with a lifetime
of order of 10° seconds. It is the carrier of the weak nuclear force and is a partner to W’ and

—— =»

W’ bosons, that mediate radioactive decay processes. In weak interactions, W and Z bosons -

many nuclear processes such as the reactions that power stars. They are very short-lived
particles, with a lifetime of order of 3x10” seconds. They do not have their anti-particles.

14.6.5 The Higgs Boson

Up*to the year 1964, the mass of a particle was considered as intrinsic property. In 1964, Peters
Higgs proposed a particle which is responsible for the mass of matter, which he called it Higgs
particle. In July, 2012 this particle was experimentally confirmed at CERN. Higgs particle has a
mass of 124.97 GeV/c’, making it 130 times more massive than a proton. Peter Higgs gave the
idea of a new type of a field, called the Higgs field that fills the universe and gives mass to all
elementary particles. It is a scalar field and the Higgs boson is a wave in that field. It has a zero
spin, zero electrical charge and no strong force interactions.

All the above four particles were gauge bosons that is a form of force carrier, while Higgs boson

is an elementary particle which is produced due to quantum excitation of Higgs field.

¢ Quarks interact strongly with the Higgs field, gaining relatively large mass.

e Electrons (lepton) interact only slightly with the Higgs field, making them extremely light
particles.

* Photons have no mass, and hence do not interact with the Higgs field.

14.6.6 Theories about Generation of Force and Mass

In classical physics, we study only the macroscopic concepts of mass and forces. However, in
quantum physics, these two entities have very different meanings. As we know that there are
four basic forces of nature, i.e. strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, electromagnetic force
and the gravitational force. Two main theories about the force generation are discussed here.
The generation of mass, as explained above involves Higgs field. For force we have two main
theories i.e., quantum field theory and the string theory.

Quantum Field Theory (QFT):

Quantum field theory is a set of physical principles that combine the elements of quantum
mechanics with the theory of relativity to explain the behavior of sub atomic particles and their
interactions due to a variety of force fields. Three different quantum field theories address
three of the four fundamental forces in nature. Matter interacts through these forces.
Electromagnetism explains how atoms hold together, strong nuclear force explains the stability
of nucleus and the weak nuclear force explains why some atoms undergo radioactive decay.
QFT describes the particles as excited states of quantum fields, which are more fundamental
than particles themselves. Interaction between the particles is basically an interaction between
the fields. Each interaction can be represented by a Feynman diagram. Similarly, according to
QFT, mass is not the strength of attraction of two bodies or the quantity of matter; rather, it
is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its speed and position. In precise, at the
smallest level, everything is made up of some entities or fluid-like substance call quantum field.
This field sometimes behaves like particles, sometimes like waves, and they'can even interact
with each other. -

String Theory:

String theory suggest that, the whole universe is made up of tiny vibrating strings. The => strings
are smaller than the smallest particles. These strings can twist, vibrate and fold. By twisting,
folding and vibrating they create matter, energy and forces. Phenomenon such as
electromagnetism and gravity arise from these strings. This theory replaces point-like particles
to one dimensional string. According to this theory strings have characteristics like charge and
mass and the characteristics of strings are controlled by their vibrations. According to string
theory, the matter composition is shown in Fig. 14.16.

14.7 PARTICLE ANNIHILATION

Einstein’s famous mass-energy equation indicates that mass can be converted into energy and
vice versa. As we studied earlier, that soon after Big Bang matter and anti-matter were formed.
What will happen if matter comes close to its anti-matter? They annihilate each other and
convert their mass into energy in accordance with Einstein’s mass-energy equation. A particle
and its anti-particle cannot exist in the same place, because when they come close to each
other, they annihilate each other. After annihilation process, the product is the energy in the

form of gamma ray photons. If an electron and a positron come in a close proximity, they —

annihilate each other and forms two gamma ray photons.

14.7.1 Annihilation of Matter into Matter

Annihilation not only gives us energy by totally destroying the particles, but it can also produce
some new particles. If quarks with their
own flavored anti-quark come close to
each other, they annihilate each other,
producing energy and a new pair of quark
and anti-quark. The annihilation of an up
quark and an anti-up quark is shown in
Fig. 14.18, in which at first, they
annihilate each other by producing
energy, and then through gluons
interactions, they finally produce a top
quark and an anti-top quark.

ticle detector widely used in high energy physics for muon’s
detection. It is relatively new and standard technology. It is known for very high detection
efficiency (>95%), excellent sub-na time resolution, high counting rates and relatively low cost.
This detector is easy to build, covers owe areas and is extensively used in nuclear facilities like BESIII,
ALICE and CMS at CERN. It operates on the principle of ionizing a gas when particles traverse through it.

14.8 PARTICLE ACCELERATORS

In High Energy Physics (Particle Physics), we need to accelerate particles to very high speeds
to study their behavior at high energies. We use to collide these high energy particles to
produce new particles. For such high energies to achieve, we need projectiles that can
accelerate the particles to higher velocities. The instruments used to accelerate the
particles up to a desired speed and energy are called accelerators. There are two basic
types of particle accelerators i.e. linear accelerators and circular accelerators, including
synchrotrons and cyclotrons.

Linear Accelerators (LINACS)

We use linear accelerators (LINACS) to get a steady, intense beam of particle. The SLAC National
Accelerator Laboratory has the longest LINAC in the world, which is 2 miles long and can
accelerate a particle up to 50 billion eV. Linear accelerators consist of a set of cylindrical
accelerating tubes (drift tubes) of increasing length which are connected alternately in a
vacuum chamber. In its odd numbered of cylinders are positive and even numbered of cylinders
are negative, with the potential to the tubes reversing periodically according to the oscillating
frequency. An oscillator alternates the polarity of the tubes. An ion source is used to produce
ions which are to be accelerated. An accelerated beam of charge particles leaves the drift
tubes and moves towards the target. A schematic diagram of a linear accelerator is shown in

Fig. 14.19.

Resistive plate chamber (RPC) is a

Synchrotron Accelerators

Blectromagnets
- the particle beams in
the center of the pipe.

_ Figure 14.19: Linear accelerator.

Synchrotron accelerators, also called the ‘heavy lifters’, are circular accelerators. These are
the highest energy accelerators in the world. These accelerators have a closed pathway that

moves particles in a ring.

When a particle enters the accelerator it moves repeatedly in the circular path, which is

enclosed in a vacuum pipe. Radiofrequency cavities
atgintervals around the ring increase their speeds.
ral magnets create electromagnetic fields to
bend the particles’ path. The maximum energy
obtained by the synchrotron accelerator is 13.6 TeV
which was produced during the proton collision in the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.
Researchers send different beams to collide at
required energy at fixed points, where particle
detectors (like Compact Muon Solenoid CMS) are
positioned to detect the particles produced by these
collisions. Synchrotron accelerators are used to study
the basic building blocks of the universe. Synchrotron
accelerators like LHC can accelerate heavy ions and
nuclei like lead, At RHIC accelerator in USA, the
heavy ions like uranium and gold to create quark-
gluon plasma. A schematic diagram of a
synchrotron accelerator is shown in Fig. 14.20 (a).
Cyclotron Accelerators
Cyclotron accelerators, accelerate the particles in
a spiral pattern, starting from the center of spiral.
They use one large electromagnet to bend the path
of particles. To move particles in increasing larger
circles, they use metal electrodes. Cyclotrons can
accelerate particles to 520 million eV. Cyclotron
accelerators consist of two circular metal boxes
called ‘dees’, which are separated from each other

and connected to a radiofrequency oscillator of frequency 10’ Hz, and alternating potential of
10 kV is applied between dees.

They can draw particles from different parts of the accelerator at different energies. Source of
ion is placed in the middle from which ions move outward in spiral path in applied electric and’
magnetic fields.

Just like at very high energies, electrons are not confined to their atoms
i.e., electrons and ions are found in plasma state. Similarly, at very high
energies, the baryonic matter gets the same plasma state called quark-
gluon plasma, the high temperature soup that made up the universe just
after the Big Bang. In this state of baryonic matter, quarks and gluons
are no longer confined to each other by the strong force. Instead, they
become free from their mutual attraction. ;

Particle accelerators are not only used for scientific research but they can also be used in
various other field of daily life, including medical field. Some uses of particle accelerators are
listed below: . ,

e Linear accelerators are used to produce medical isotopes, and create beams of radiations
for cancer treatment. Electron linear accelerator (LINACS) for cancer therapy is the most
common type of particle accelerator. It serves as injectors for higher energy accelerators.
They generate x-rays and high energy electrons for radiation therapy.

¢ Synchrotron accelerators are used to produce high energy environment to study the
building blocks of the universe. Higgs boson was discovered using these accelerators. In the
medical field, they are used for studying cell biology, crystallography, high resolution
imaging, and cancer radiation therapy. In environmental sciences they use in toxicology,
clean combustion and atmospheric research. They are also used in agriculture, mineral
exploration, engineering and forensics.

¢ Cyclotron accelerators are used to produce large number of certain types of particles, such
as muons and neutrinos. They are also used to produce medical isotopes. They are the best
source of high-energy beams for particle physics experimentation. They use in particle

therapy to treat cancer.

To Find: (a) Kinetic energy of electron: EF. =?

Now the y-component of momentum (ignoring nucleus):

As the pair have equal momentum, they must have equal energy. Hence equation (1) gets the
form: :

3 MeV =2E

Energy of either of the pair is: E => Mev = 1.5MeV

The rest mass energy of each particle is 0.511 MeV, hence:

K.E =(1.5—0.511) MeV

KE crectron = K-E positron = 0989 MeV
(b) To ensure x-component of momentum to be conserved (as positron and electron are movin

As the nuclear energy has a very small value, the nucleus can preserve momentum conservation

of nucleus while dividing the energy of incoming photon between electron and positron.

Nuclear radiation includes three types of particles: alpha particle with double positive
charge and heaviest among all, beta particle with negative charge and medium mass and

_ the gamma photon which is‘neutral and massless.
Conservation laws are the universal principles which must be followed during every

interaction and decay of particles.

Matter and anti-matter are the two distinct forms of particles, identical in all respects
except charge and magnetic moment. :

Quarks are the elementary particles which make up all matter in the universe, these are of
six types.

Hadrons are the particles which are made up of quarks.

Baryons are the particles which are made up of three quarks, proton and neutron are
baryons. ASR
Mesons are the particles which are made up of a quark and an anti-quark, pions are the
examples of mesons. . :
Beta positive decay is the process in which proton converts into a neutron by changing one
of its up quarks into down quark, producing a positron and an electron neutrino through the
emission of W-boson. :

Beta negative decay is the process in which neutron converts into a proton by changing one
of its down quarks into up quark, by producing an electron and an anti-neutrino through W-
boson.

Leptons are the lightest particles among the fermions; electron and muon are examples of
the leptons. :

Photon, gluon, W and Z bosons are the force carriers responsible for the exchange of
electromagnetic, strong and weak force respectively.

Higgs boson ‘is the particle associated with the Higgs fields which particle interact with to
acquire masses.

Particle and anti -particle whenever come close to each other, they annihilate each other
by releasing energy or by forming a set of another particle and anti-particle pair.

Particle accelerators are instruments used for accelerating the particle up to very high

speed and high energies for research and technology.
