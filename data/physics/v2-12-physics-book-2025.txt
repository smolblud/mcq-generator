Gravity, a force that has fascinated scientists for centuries, is essential in shaping the universe.
It keeps us firmly held on Earth and controls the movements of stars in galaxies. Newton's law
of gravitation has been crucial in helping us comprehend this force.

Our galaxy, the Milky-Way, is a prime example of gravity's strength. It is a vast disk of stars,
dust, and gas held together by the powerful gravitational force of its center. Even though we
are located near the edge of the galaxy, about 26,000 light-years from the center, we are not
alone. The Milky-Way is part of the Local Group, a cluster of galaxies that includes the
Andromeda Galaxy, just 2.5 million light-years away. Gravity is the master of this cosmic dance.
It controls the movements of stars within our galaxy and influences how galaxies interact with
each other. As we explore gravity further, we develop a deeper understanding of the force that
shapes the universe on large scale.

io. 1 NEWTON'S LAW OF UNIVERSAL GRAVITATION

Newton formulated a law called the law of universal gravitation to describe the force of
attraction between various objects in the universe; which is stated as follows:

Every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force which is directly
proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the
distance between their centres.

Newton's law of universal gravitation revolutionized our understanding of the physical world
and provided a mathematical framework for explaining the motion of celestial bodies such as
planets, moons, and stars. It laid the foundation for the development of classical mechanics
and helped to explain many phenomena in the natural world, from the tides caused by the
gravitational pull of the moon to the orbiting of planets around the sun.

Today, Newton's law of universal gravitation is still used as a fundamental principle in physics
and astronomy, although it has been refined and expanded upon by later theories such as
Einstein's theory of general relativity. Nevertheless, Newton's law of universal gravitation
remains a cornerstone of our understanding of the force that governs the motion of objects in

the universe.

Consider two spherical bodies of masses ‘m;’ and ‘m2’ separated by distance ‘r’, as shown in
Fig. 15.1. By definition of Newton’s law of universal gravitation, the force of gravity ‘F,’ is:

F, cm, xm, ‘,

Where ‘G’ is constant of proportionality and is known as gravitational constant. Its value is

Gravitational force is always attractive and does

not depend upon the medium between the masses. Force (N)
The gravitational force is an inverse-square force:
it decreases by a factor of 4 when the distance F

increases by a factor of 2, it decreases by a factor
of 9 when the distance increases by a factor of 3,
and so on. Graph in Fig. 15.2 is a plot of the
magnitude of the gravitational force as a function
of the distance, between two objects.

These two forces act like action and reaction which are equal es

to each other in magnitude but opposite in direction. It means that Newton’s universal law of
gravitation is consistent with Newton’s 3 law motion.

Example 15.1: Two bodies A and B are placed at a distance of 1 m from each other. What
will be the force of attraction between them if their masses are 45 kg and 50 kg
respectively?

Hence F,=1.5x107N

This implies that we are drawn towards each other, but the force is so minuscule, around
10’ N, that it goes unnoticed unless we employ highly sensitive instruments. Even massive
objects such as ships and buildings experience a very slight gravitational pull.

Se i ‘OINTEROLRONDER!
The gravitational constant ‘G’ is crucial for

calculating gravitational forces accurately.
However, measuring such a small number was a
challenge. It took scientists 100 years after
Newton's work to create a device capable of
measuring G. In 1798, Henry Cavendish, an
Englishman, used a torsion balance apparatus
(shown in figure) to measure the gravitational
force between two objects. This experiment not
only helped determine G but also raised questions
about whether gravitational force varies in
different mediums, such as air and water. Knowing
G also led to obtaining precise values for Earth's
mass and other astr ical masses.

15.2 GRAVITATIONAL FIELD STRENGTH

The area around a massive object (like Earth, sun, etc.) where its gravitational force acts is
known as gravitational field.

Gravitational field is represented by field lines that indicate the direction and strength of
gravity, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Closer lines represent a stronger field, while farther apart lines
indicate a weaker field.

The gravitational field lines point radially inward uniformly in all directions for a point mass (a
point mass is treated as if all its mass is concentrated at a single point in space), forming a
symmetric pattern. Since a gravitational force is an interaction between a test mass and the
gravitational field created by the source mass, therefore from Newton’s second law of motion:

m
F
Similarly, a,= = =g

Gravitational field can be defined by gravitational field strength, denoted by ‘g’. The
gravitational field strength is a vector with a magnitude of ‘g’ pointing in the direction of the
gravitational force. The value of ‘g’ is the gravitational force on a unit mass at that point, or
‘g = F,/m’. Therefore, gravitational field strength and acceleration due to gravity are
equivalent.

Value of ‘g' on Surface of the Earth

Newton’s law of universal gravitation shows that the value of ‘g’ depends on mass and distance.

For example, consider an object (stone) of mass ‘mo’ placed on surface of Earth. Let ‘Me’ be
the mass of the Earth and radius of Earth ‘Re’ is the distance between their centres (as radius
of stone is very small compared to radius of Earth, therefore it is ignored). The gravitational
force between the stone and Earth is:

F, =Goee 15.
Oe (15.1)

The gravitational force F, by Newton’s second law is:

Comparing Eq. (15.1) and Eq. (15.2), we get: Mm, = cm

For Earth we know ro mass of Earth Me = 6 x 10 kg and radius of Earth Re = 6.4 x on m and

' 6x10" , e
8=6.67 10" x Te or g=9.77ms*=9.8ms*
Eq. (15.3) shows that the value of ‘g’ does not depend upon the mass ‘m.’ of the body. This
means that light and heavy bodies should fall at same rate. This equation also shows that
gravitational field strength depends only on mass of Earth ‘Me’ and radius of Earth ‘Re’.
Therefore, on any other planet's surface, both the value of ‘g’ and our weight will be influenced
by the planet's mass ‘m’ and radius ‘r’, therefore the Eq. (15.3) in more general form can be

expressed as:

Variation of 'g’ with Altitude

Moving away from surface of Earth may change ‘g’ and
therefore our weight. The value of “g’ at a given place
depends upon the distance from the centre of Earth, as shown
in Fig. 15.4.

Let ‘gn’ be the value of acceleration due to gravity at a height
‘h’ from the surface of the Earth. We can rewrite
gravitational field strength from Eq. (15.3) as:

The change in 'g' is only noticeable at very long distances, as indicated in the Table 15.1.

Assignment 15.2
What will be the value of gravitational filed strength ‘g’ at 35,700 km, where geostationary
satellites orbit around the Earth?

Gravitational Fields Lines

To better understand the gravitational field
surrounding the Earth, we can visualize the planet . 8
as a perfectly uniform sphere. This simplification
allows us to analyse the gravitational effects more
easily. A uniform sphere has a consistent density
throughout. The concept of a uniform sphere
simplifies the understanding of complex mass
distributions, which is crucial in astrophysics and g
planetary science. It allows for easier calculations
of gravitational forces for stars, planets, and
moons without considering differences in their
density. Its gravitational field behaves as follows:

Putting values, we get: g, = or Sn= 9.4 ms"

A. Outside the Sphere: The field acts as if all
mass is concentrated at the centre, resembling g
that of a point mass with the same total mass. Figure 15.5: GravitationalField Lines.

For locations that are situated outside the Earth's

surface, we can conceptualize the Earth's mass as being concentrated at a single point located
at its centre. This model is useful because it simplifies the calculations involved in
understanding gravitational forces.

As shown in Fig. 15.5, this representation illustrates how the strength of the gravitational field
reduces rapidly as one moves away from the Earth. This behaviour aligns with our expectations
as one would expect from the inverse-square nature of Newton’s law of universal gravitation.

B. Inside the Sphere: The gravitational field strength increases steadily toward the surface, as
only the mass within the radius affects the field at any point inside.

7.3 x 10 kg, what is its radius?

A satellite is any object that orbits the
planet due to the force of gravity,
maintaining a stable path around it.

A natural body orbiting a planet, dwarf
planet, or minor planet, where the
larger body's gravity dominates the
system, is called a natural satellite. Six
of the major planets possess natural
satellites often termed as moons.

Artificial Satellites

Artificial satellites are objects
intentionally placed into orbit around
the Earth or other celestial bodies.
Different orbits for artificial satellites
are shown in Fig. 15.6. The first
artificial satellite was launched in 1957,
and since then, thousands have been
sent for various purposes such as

Orbital Velocity

THe orbital velocity of a satellite refers to the minimum velocity required for a satellite to orbit
the Earth or another celestial body at a specific altitude.

When a satellite is moving with velocity ‘vo’ ina circle of radius ‘r’ from the centre of earth, it

ence orbital velocity also depends upon the mass of the larger body and the distance from the
centre of the larger body to the centre of mass of the satellite.

‘National Book Foundation : 15-Gravitation

--- PAGE 15 ---
Eq. (15.8) tells us that the satellite in the orbit moves faster
when it is close to the gravitating body (i.e., Earth) and
slower when it is further away.

As the size of satellite is small as compared to the size of
Earth and the distance in between therefore ‘r’ is taken as
the sum of the radius of Earth ‘Re’ and height ‘h’.

Therefore, Eq. (15.9), can also be written as:

As the speed decreases due to height, we may have certain
orbit such that the satellite covers a complete round trip in
twenty-four hours and. it. appears stationary above certain
fixed point.

would be the radius of a synchronous satellite for this planet?

Venus, due to its incredibly slow rotation, cannot have a stable geostationary orbit at 1,530,000
km (or even close to that distance). Due to Venus’s lower mass compared to Earth, its Hill sphere
is significantly smaller. At a distance of 1,530,000 km, the satellite would likely be outside
Venus's Hill sphere and more influenced by the Sun's gravity. This would cause the satellite's
orbit to become unstable, and it wouldn't remain stationary over a fixed point on Venus.

Therefore, while the mathematical formula provides a solution, it doesn't represent a feasible
scenario for a synchronous satellite around Venus.

The formula AP.E = mgh is accurate for potential
energy near the Earth's surface where gravity is
constant. However, as we move away from the
surface, gravity weakens, making the equation
invalid. Instead, we must use an expression based on
Newton's law of universal gravitation.

Secondly, to calculate gravitational potential energy,
we need to establish a zero-reference point, often
the Earth's surface. This choice results in negative
potential energy for any finite distance ‘r’ because
potential energy decreases as objects move closer to
the zero-reference point and increases as they move
apart.

Consider the Fig. 15.10 in which a body of mass ‘m’
is placed at surface of Earth having distance from the
centre of the Earth ‘Re’ (equal to the radius of Earth).
As mass of Earth is ‘Me’ and to displace the body from
point ‘1’ to ‘n’, we divide the whole distance into a
number of small distances each of magnitude ‘Ar’, § ae me sty
such that the force during each interval remains

constant.

The work done from point ‘0’ to point ‘1’ is ‘W1’, which can be written as:

Since ‘Ar’ is very very small, the square of the term will be so small that it approaches to ZERO,

Now to exclude the choice of setting a reference point for calculation, we set point ‘n’ at

a mass ‘m’ from infinity to the surface of Earth.

SUMMARY

&

&

Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation: Every object in the universe attracts every other
object with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and
inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centres.

Satellite: A satellite is any object that orbits another object due to the force of gravity,
maintaining a stable path around it.

Orbital velocity: In circular orbit a satellite has a constant tangential speed called orbital
velocity.

Geostationary satellite: A geostationary satellite, also Known as a geosynchronous
equatorial orbit (GEO) satellite, is a type of satellite that orbits the Earth directly above
the equator at an altitude where its orbital period matches the Earth's rotation period. This
results in the satellite appearing stationary relative to a fixed point on the Earth's surface.

Absolute gravitational potential energy: The potential energy possessed by a body at a
certain height in a gravitational field with respect to reference point of zero potential is

known as absolute potential energy.

Gravitational potential: The gravitational potential is the gravitational potential energy
per unit mass.

Statistical mechanics provides a foundation for understanding thermodynamic properties like
energy, entropy, and temperature by using the principles of thermodynamics.

Statistical mechanics is a branch of physics that applies statistical methods to understand the
behavior of physical systems composed of a large number of particles. It offers a framework for
understanding the behavior of complex systems, from the microscopic to the macroscopic level.
In the present chapter, we shall relate volume, pressure, and temperature to the microscopic
properties like speed and kinetic energy of gas molecules. Statistical mechanics is applied to
various complex systems, from materials science to biological systems.

16.1 PRESSURE EXERTED BY GAS MOLECULES

The molecules of a gas are in a state of continuous random motion in a container. They collide
with one another and also with the walls of the container. Due to collisions of gas molecules
with the walls, their momentum changes. Due to their elastic collisions, they transfer an equal
amount of momentum to the walls of the container. According to Newton’s second law of
motion, the rate of transfer of momentum (Ap/At) by the gas molecules to the walls is equal
to the force (F) exerted on the wall. This force exerted by the gas molecules per unit area (A)
of the walls is equal to the pressure exerted by the gas.

Hence, the pressure that the gas exerts.on the box
depends upon the number of molecules that hit

each side of the box in one second and the force
with which a molecule collides with the wall.

force on it. The force exerted per unit area of the

wall is the pressure of the gas.

Consider a single gas molecule of mass “m” moving towards face-1 of the container with the x-
component of its velocity v,,. So, initial momentum of the molecule along the x-direction is

mv,,. At face-1 of the container, the molecule has perfectly elastic collision and bounces back,

(its momentum is reversed). So, after the collision final momentum in the negative x-direction
is —mv,,. Therefore, change in momentum of a gas molecule along the x-direction is:

Ap = -mv,, -(mv,,)
Ap ay -2mv,,

According to the law of conservation of momentum, the momentum imparted to the wali by
the molecule will be 2mv,,.

--- PAGE 28 ---
After colliding with face-1 of the container, the molecule travels to opposite face-2 and collide
with it, rebounds, and travels back to face-1. So, the gas molecule cover distance ‘2\’ before
it again collides with face-1. The time At taken by gas molecule to covers this distance ‘2’ is
given by:

At = Bad (16.2)

So, the rate of change of momentum of a gas molecule along x-axis is:

This is the expression for the pressures of ideal gas.

Pressure is affected by volume.
As the volume of the container
decreases molecules contained
within a smaller volume. As a

result, the particle collisions
occur more frequently with the
sides of the container, exerting a
higher pressure.

When the volume of the
container increases, there is
more space, so less frequent
collisions with the walls of the
container, exerting a lower

pressure.

16.3 MODIFICATION OF THE IDEAL GAS MODEL TO DISCUSS
BEHAVIOUR OF NON-IDEAL GASES

Behaviour of Ideal Gases

As we know that in the ideal gas model, the size of gas molecules is negligible, there are no
interactions between them, and the collisions between each other and with the walls of the
container are perfectly elastic.

Gas that obeys the ideal gas law (PV = n RT) is called an ideal gas. The ideal gas law governs
macroscopic properties, e.g., temperature, pressure, volume, quantity of gas, and entropy.
Although there is no such thing in nature asa truly ideal gas, gases can approach the ideal state
at low pressure and high temperatures. We have seen that the temperature of an ideal gas can

be determined as T = 7) . This equation implies that temperature (a macroscopic property

of a gas) is defined by the motion of an individual particle (a microscopic quantity). Hence,
different results for ideal gas provide connections between its microscopic and macroscopic
quantities. This gives rise to a branch of physics called statistical mechanics.

Statistical mechanics is a branch of physics that connects the microscopic details of a system,
such as motion, energy, and the interaction of individual particles, with the macroscopic
observables we measure, such as temperature, pressure, volume, and entropy.

Statistical mechanics provides a mathematical foundation for thermodynamics, which is
otherwise a phenomenological theory.

Behaviour of Non-Ideal Gases

The ideal gas law works well for large volumes, high temperatures, and low pressure, but it
fails to explain the behavior of gases under high pressure, high density, and low temperature
(where molecules move slowly and interact with each other). It also fails when strong
gravitational forces act like those in stars. To account for these deviations from ideal behavior,
modifications were made to the ideal gas law.

Van Der Waals Equation

The ideal gas equation PV = n R T can be used for real gases at high temperatures as well as
low pressures at which intermolecular forces are negligibly small. Van der Waals modified this
equation so that it can be used for real gases at wide ranges of temperature and pressure. Van

Nationa! Book Foundation i5-Statisticat Mechanics & Thermodynamics

--- PAGE 35 ---
der Waals assumed that the gas molecules are hard spheres with definite volume and that two
gas molecules somehow interact with each other, especially at low temperatures when
molecules move slowly. He made the following corrections:

(i) Volume Correction: The size of gas Volume = V Volurne = V- b

molecules is not negligible, but it has a
finite size, and some part of the volume
of gas is occupied by the gas molecules.
So, the space available for the motion of
molecules of gas will be slightly less than
the volume of gas ‘V’. Roughly ‘b’ is the ideal Gas Real Gas

volume of one mole of gas molecules. Figure 16.2: Illustration of volume correction.
Hence, effective volume becomes (V — b), as shown in Fig. 16.2.

(ii) Pressure Correction: At low temperature, molecules interact somehow. Inside the
container, interaction between gas molecules cancel each other, but particles near the surface
and walls of the container have net inward force, as shown in Fig. 16.3. The effective pressure

of the real gas is calculated by [P + ae } Van der Waal’s equation for 1 mole of a gas is:

inward pull Molecular attraction

(P+ S)(v-b)=Rr

Here ‘a’ and ‘b’ are empirical constants, their values are
different for different gases. For ‘n’ moles of the gas
effective volume becomes (V -n-b) and effective pressure

(16.26)

a
becomes [P - | , therefore Vander Waal’s equation for

Figure 16.3: Illustration
‘n’ mole of a gas is; pressure correction.

(16.27)

gees
[P+ an \v nb) =nRT

This equation is designed to describe the behavior of real gases, but it can still be used for ideal
gases as well. Real gases or non-ideal gases approach ideal behavior at a high temperature and
low pressure. At high temperatures or at very low pressure, volume ‘V’ is very large. So, the

terms ‘ a and ‘b’ can then be neglected. In this situation, Van der Waals’ equation reduces

’

to the ideal gas equation (P V = n RT).
16.4 Gravitational Effects on ideal Gas Model

‘In the ideal gas model (i.e., the ideal gas law) at the laboratory scale, gravity is much weaker
as compared to other factors such as the kinetic energy of the gas molecules and the pressure
of the gas. That’s why, it makes sense to ignore gravity for ideal gas. But on a large scale, e.g.,

in a star, gravity plays an important role in their stability.
Accounting for gravity requires much more complex models as
compared to the ideal gas model to understand the behaviour
of gas molecules.

In the core of stars, heat produced by fusion, radiation
pressure, and degeneracy pressure by quantum effects,
generate net outward pressure that is counterbalanced by
gravity, a state known as hydrostatic equilibrium, as shown in
Fig. 16.4. This ensures stability in the stars.

16.5 BEHAVIOUR OF MATTER UNDER EXTREME PHYSICAL
CONDITIONS

In the universe, there are many cases in which matter has evolved in to extreme physical
conditions. Extreme physical conditions can alter the behavior of matter, leading to unique and
unusual states of matter such as degenerate matter and phenomena like Bose-Einstein
condensation, superconductivity states, superfluidity; and other quantum phenomena. These
conditions are observable at extremely high pressure or at extremely low pressure, by materials
of high density or by materials experiencing high gravitational force. We will learn how these
conditions lead to unusual states of matter.

16.5.1 Degenerate Matter

Extremely high pressure can cause particles to interact closely where quantum mechanical
effects, particularly the Pauli Exclusion Principle become significant. The Pauli Exclusion
Principle states that:

Two electrons cannot occupy the same quantum state.

Degenerate matter happens when gravity squeezes atoms so tightly under extremely high -
pressure in a star that they change from their normal state.

Normally, atoms are made up of a nucleus and electrons Gravitational pressure
revolving around the nucleus. But when the pressure is
extremely high, electrons are strongly pressed tightly against
the nucleus in high energy states (according to Pauli Exclusion
principle) and they cannot move freely. At this stage, electrons
show resistance against gravity and other forces for further
compression. This resistance is called degeneracy pressure,
which counteract the effect of gravity and other. compressive
forces, as shown in Fig. 16.5. So, degenerated matter is matter
that is packed so tightly that its electrons are forced into a
tightly packed configuration.

Degenerate matter is typically formed in the cores of white Figure 16.5: Degeneracy

16.5.2 Neutron Stars

Neutron stars are formed from the
remnants of more massive stars. In neutron
stars, matter is further compressed by the
gravity, due to which electrons and protons
start to combine to form neutrons.
Therefore, neutrons degenerate pressure
arises due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle,
which balances gravity, preventing further
compression, as shown in Fig. ,16.7. This
stable state of matter is known as neutron
Stars.

Despite the fact, that a neutron star is only
about 20 km in diameter, it is about 1.5
times more massive than the sun. Neutron
stars have overall densities of the order Of Figure 16.7: Neutron star.

10’ kg m®. Newly formed neutron stars,

known as “hot neutron stars,” can have a surface temperature of a several million degrees
Celsius.

16.5.3 Bose-Einstein Condensation _.. ‘
Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) is a state of matter that forms at extremely low

temperatures, such as close to absolute zero, causing
particles kinetic energies to decrease significantly. At this e temperature inside a newly
low temperature, bosons (e.g., photons, W bosons, Z sce cage ging ioe

16.5.4 Super Fluidity

A notable property of Bose-Einstein Condensation is superfluidity, where condensate shows zero
viscosity, allowing it to flow without resistance. Superfluidity is observed when certain fluids
are cooled to extremely low temperatures, close to absolute zero. This results in special
qualities, like a fluid's capacity to pass through incredibly small spaces at a steady speed
without the aid of outside forces.

It can also lead to remarkable behaviour, such as the ability to form persistent vortices. In fluid
dynamics, a vortex is a region in a fluid in which the flow revolves around an axis line, which

may be straight or curved.

National Book Foundation 16-Statistical Mechanics & Thermodynamics

--- PAGE 39 ---
16.5.5 Super Conductivity

In certain conditions, Bose-Einstein condensation leads to superconductivity, where electrical
resistance drops to zero, allowing current to flow without resistance. This occurs when two
electrons form boson-like entities called cooper pairs, which can then occupy the same state
and move through the material without scattering.

Below the superconducting transition temperature, paired electrons form a condensate (a
macroscopically occupied single quantum state that flows without resistance).

Superconductivity is the property of certain materials to conduct current without energy loss
when they are cooled below.a critical temperature or transition temperature.

Superconductors are those substances whose resistivity become zero at very low specific
temperatures.

Critical temperature (T,):

The low temperature at which and below which the resistivity
p of substance become zero is called the critical temperature
or superconducting transition temperature, as shown in Fig.
16.8.

Superconductivity was first discovered in 1911 by Dutch

physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes when he observed the

sudden disappearance of electrical resistance in mercury at © ‘* T (kK)

Applications of superconductors:

Researchers continue to explore ways to achieve superconductivity at higher temperatures,
which would make it more practical for everyday use.

SUMMARY

* Pressure of gas: The pressure exerted by a gas molecule is a measure of the force exerted
by gas molecules per unit area as they collide with the walls of their container.

* The pressure exerted by the gas molecules on the walls of the container is directly

* Mean kinetic energy of a moving gas molecule of an ideal gas is directly proportional to the

* Pauli Exclusion Principle states that “two electrons cannot occupy same quantum state”.

* Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) Predicted by Bose and Einstein in the 1920s, this is a unique
state of matter at extremely low temperatures, where a group of boson particles occupy

quantum mechanical effects dominate over classical mechanics. This typically occurs in
extremely high-pressure environments, such as the cores of massive stars like white dwarfs,
neutron stars.

* White dwarfs are formed due to remnants of low to intermediate mass stars. When a star
has used up all of its fusion fuel, it removes its outer layers and contracts to form a white
dwarf.

* Neutron stars are formed from the remnants of more massive stars. In neutron stars, matter
is further compressed by gravity. Due to this, electrons and protons start to combine to
form neutrons.

Have you ever wondered why a pendulum swings back and forth, or how a guitar string vibrates
to produce sound? Perhaps you've noticed the smooth motion of a child on a swing or the
rhythmic movement of a spring-based toy. These phenomena are all connected by a
fundamental concept in physics: Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM). SHM can be observed in various
natural and man-made systems. It is in the rhythms of nature, how the universe moves,
vibration of atoms, mechanical systems that engineers create, and countless other systems
from everyday life.

In this chapter, we'll delve into the world of SHM, exploring topics such as oscillations, uniform.
circular motion, phase of motion, and energy conservation. We'll also examine the differences
between free and forced oscillations, and discover the fascinating phenomenon of resonance.

Sometimes harmonic motion can cause problems. One famous example is the collapse of
Tacoma Narrows Bridge, The bridge was designed by structural engineers who did not
adequately take into account the role of harmonic motion and it led into its collapse. So, let's
go to uncover the rhythm of such a motion!

17,1 OSCILLATIONS

What does a child on a swing, the pendulum of a clock and bouncing of children on the
trampoline (as shown in Fig.17.1), all have in common? They all oscillate, i.e., they move ‘back
and forth between two points.

Figure 17.1; Examples of oscillation in our surrounding.

When a body moves to and fro about its mean position, then such motion is called vibratory or
oscillatory motion.

In our surrounding, there are many other systems which oscillate. For examples,

Terms Related to Oscillations
In this section, we shall know about some important terms related to oscillatory motion.

(i) Displacement (x): The distance of vibrating body from the equilibrium position on either
side at any instant of time is known as displacement. Its S! unit is meter (m).

(ii) Amplitude (x. or A): The maximum displacement of a vibrating body from mean position
is called amplitude. Its SI unit is meter (m).

(iii) Time Period (T): The time taken to complete one oscillation or vibration is called time
period of the oscillation. It is denoted by T. Its SI unit is second (s).

(iv) Frequency (f): The number of vibrations or oscillations (n) per unit time (t) is called
frequency. It is denoted by f, and f= ; . Its SI unit is hertz (Hz).
One hertz is defined as: the one oscillation per second. The relationship between frequency
and time period is:
1 . Py

(v) Angular Frequency («): Angular displacement per unit time is called angular frequency.
It is related to the frequency ‘f’ and time period ‘T’ of the oscillation by the expressions as:

17.2 SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION cet S|

Simple Harmonic Motion is a type of motion in which a system oscillates back and forth around
a mean (equilibrium) position. It is characterized by a restoring force. Simple harmonic motion
(SHM) is defined as:

National Book Foundation _17-Simple Harmonic Motion

--- PAGE 47 ---
Such oscillatory motion in which acceleration of a particle is directly proportional to its
displacement from the mean position and is always directed towards the mean position.

Mathematically, simple harmonic motion is expressed as:
anx-—x

SHM can be observed in many natural phenomena. A
good example.of SHM is motion of mass (m) attached to
an elastic spring. The other end of spring is connected
to a fixed support, as shown in Fig. 17.3.

Let us assume that the mass of spring is ignored and the
mass is free to move on a frictionless, horizontal
surface. In the absence of an external force, the spring
is neither stretched nor compressed. Hence, the mass
stays at its equilibrium or mean position, which we
identify as x = 0, as shown in Fig. 17.3 (b).

Let the mass is stretched towards right through a
displacement ‘x’ from its equilibrium position by
applying a force F, as shown in Fig. 17.3 (a). Due to
elasticity, spring exerts an opposite force on the mass x=0

which is proportional to the displacement ‘x’ from Figure 17.3: Mass ‘m’ oscillates on
mean position. This force is called restoring force. This horizontal surface.

restoring force obeys Hooke’s law, i.e.,

F=—kx (17.1)
‘Here ‘k’ is called the spring constant. The SI unit of kis Nm”.

The negative sign in Eq. (17.1) shows that the force exerted by spring is always directed
opposite to the displacement of the mass from mean position.

When the mass is displaced to the right of mean position, the displacement x is positive but the
restoring force is directed to the left (mean position).

’

When the mass is released, it moves towards the mean position. Due to inertia, it cannot stop
at mean position and goes ahead. Then the mass begins to compress the spring and slows down,

coming to rest at the left side of the mean position equal to its initial distance on right side, as
shown in Fig. 17.3 (c).

The compressed spring then pushes the mass back toward the mean position. Again, the mass
cannot stop at the mean position and goes ahead. The result is that the mass oscillates back
and forth about the mean position. Since the mass is continuously changing its direction, so it

accelerates. According to Newton’s second law of motion, the force acting on the mass is
given by:

F=ma (17.2)

National Book Foundation r 17-Simple Harmonic Motion

--- PAGE 48 ---
By comparing Eq. (17.1) and Eq. (17.2), we get:

ma=—kx

(17.3)

In Eq. (17.3),

? is constant. So, angular
frequency of ‘mass attached to the spring’ is:

k
@= —
m

(17.4)

Now Eq. (17.3) can be written as:
anx—x

This relation shows that the oscillating mass exhibits
SHM; its acceleration (a) is. proportional to its
displacement (x) and is directed towards mean
position.

The atoms in a material oscillates as if
the atoms were connected by a tiny
spring, hence exhibit SHM. The spring
constant of this spring depends upon the
type of bonding between the atoms. This
model can be extended to solids, where
atoms are often thought of as being

connected to their neighbours by
springs. This leads to an experimental
way of obtaining information about
interatomic forces in the solids.

Frequency and Time Period of an Oscillating Mass-Spring System

expressions:
W=2nf= 2x
T
So, T= 22x

17.3 UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION AND SHM

There is a close connection between circular motion and
simple harmonic motion. Therefore, many aspects, such as
displacement, velocity and acceleration of simple
harmonic motion (SHM) can be understood by relating it
with uniform circular motion.

Putting values, we get: m = 6.875 kg

Consider a point P is moving on a circular path of radius x.
in xy-plane at constant angular velocity w, as shown in Fig.
17.4 (a). At the same time, Q be the projection of P on the
x-axis undergoes oscillation along the diameter of circular
path between -x. and +Xo.

It is seen that the time period of one revolution of point P Figure 17.4 (a): A point P is
on the circular path is equal to the time period of one moving on a circular path at
oscillation of point Q on the diameter. Therefore, the COnstgAt angular velocity wo.
angular speed of P is the same as the linear speed of Q. Thus, the expressions for displacement,
velocity and acceleration of P also hold for the Q.

Expressions for Displacement

As the point P moves on the circle, at some instant t, the angle made by the line OP with the
x-axis is 8 = wt. From the Fig. 17.4 (a), the instantaneous displacement x of Q at that instant
can be calculated as:

From AOPQ, ¢os@ =~

National Book Foundation 17-Simple Harmonic Motion

--- PAGE 50 ---
or X = Xo COSO = X_ Coswt (17.5)
Eq. (17.5) can be used for calculating displacement of a body executing simple harmonic
motion.

Expressions for Velocity

.Velocity of the point P at instant t is vp = Xo w, which is directed along the tangent.
Instantaneous velocity v of the point Q is the projection of vp on the x-axis, which is the
horizontal component of vp, as shown in Fig. 17.4 (b).

Vv = Vp cos(90° — 6)

or V = Vp sin® (1 7.6)
as, sin?@ + cos?@ =1 or sin? @ = 1—cos?@
so, Eq. (17.6) becomes:

v = vp ¥1—cos’? 0

or v=X%.w V1—cos?6

Using Eq. (17.5), we get:

Vv=W Ve = 2 (17.7)

Eq. (17.7) can be used for calculating velocity of a body Figure 17.4 (b): Velocity of the
executing simple harmonic motion. point P and its horizontal -

component.
Expressions for Acceleration

Since w is constant, so the acceleration of the point P is
centripetal i.e., ap = X. w*, which is directed inward towards
O. The acceleration ‘a’ of Q is the horizontal component of
ap, as, shown in Fig. 7.4 (c).

a=— ap COSd = — Xo w’ cos

Since the velocity is decreasing, so the negative sign shows
that acceleration of Q is directed towards O. Using

x
cos8 = —., we get:
X,

Figure 17.4 (c): Acceleration of
(17.8) the point P and its horizontal
component.

a=—w’x

This equation describes the SHM. Hence, the oscillatory
motion of point Q is SHM; its acceleration is proportional to its displacement and is directed
opposite to the displacement from mean position. Hence, we can conclude that:

. When a body moves in a circle, its projection undergoes simple harmonic motion on the
diameter of the circle.

So, acceleration of a body executing simple harmonic motion can be calculated by using Eq.
(17.8).

17.4 PHASE

We have studied that the instantaneous displacement of the point executing SHM is given by
the Eq. (17.5), as:

X = X_ cos@ or X = Xo Coswt
Here, 6 = wt is the phase of motion and can be defined as:

The angle 8 = wt which specifies the displacement as well as the direction of a point executing
SHM is called phase of the motion.
In general, the Eq. (17.5) can be written as:

X=Xo cos(wt + @) (17.9)

The term q is called initial phase. The inclusion of @ gives the information regarding the starting
or initial phase of oscillation.

National Book Foundation (a) 17-Simple Harmonic Motion

--- PAGE 52 ---
Physical Significance of Phase

To give the physical significance of phase, we use displacement-time graph. Since x is periodic,
so T is the time period of the oscillation.
If ~p = 0°, then Eq. (17.9) becomes:

X = Xo coswt —
Putting t = 0, T/4, T/2, 3T/4, T...., we

get a graph, as shown in Fig. 17.5 (a).
This graph shows that:

At t = 0, T/2 and T (corresponding to 6
= 0, m and 2n), the point is at the
extreme positions.

At t =.T/4 and 3T/4 (corresponding to

8 = 1/2 and 3m/2), the point is at mean

position.

if m = 90°, then Eq. (17.9) becomes:
X=X_ cos(wt + 90°)

Putting t = 0, T/4, T/2, 3T/4, T...., we
get a graph, as shown in Fig. 17.5 (b).
This graph shows that:

At t = 0, T/2 and T (corresponding to 8
= 0, 1 and 2m), the point is at mean
positions.

At t = T/4 and 3T/4 (corresponding to
6 = m/2 and 3n/2), the point is at
extreme positions.

lf m = 180°, then Eq. (17.9) becomes:

X= Xo cos(wt + 180°)

Putting t = 0, T/4, T/2, 37/4, T...., we

get a graph, as shown in Fig. 17.5 (c).

It can be noted that:

+ Similarly, the curve in Fig. 17.5 (c) leads the curve in Fig. 17.5 (a) by 180°, because their

oscillating out of phase.

When the phase difference between two oscillating systems is 0° or 360°, they are said to be
oscillating in phase.

(ii) The velocity of the particle executing SHM is

The velocity of the particle is maximum ({i.e., v =

17.6 SIMPLE PENDULUM

An ideal simple pendulum consists of a small but heavy P e frictionless
bob of mass m which is suspended by a light and '

inextensible string of length /. The other end of the string
is attached to a fixed frictionless support at point P, as
shown in Fig. 17.6 (a). : massless

When the bob is displaced slightly from its mean position rod

a circle with centre at P. Suppose that the oscillating

bob is at point A at some instant, where the bob’s™ ~ . ° ; :
displacement is x and the angle OPA = 8. The forces trajectory “sh sie" " Wassive
acting on the bob are the tension T exerted by the string ocuiitortum bob

and its weight mg acting vertically downward.

The weight mg of the bob can be resolved into its two
rectangular components, i.e.

Tension in the string exactly cancels the component

restoring force which makes it to accelerate towards
equilibrium position, i.e.,

F=—megsin6 (i)

Negative sign indicates that the force is acting towards

47.7 ENERGY CONSERVATION IN SHM

Energy of a body executing SHM remains conserved. To examine this fact, we again consider a
vibrating mass-spring system, as shown in Fig. 17.7 (a). When the spring is stretched by the
applied force ‘F’ through a displacement ‘x’, work must be done. This work W is given by:

W=F,, x (i)
According to Hooke’s law, the applied force is given by: F
F=kx (ii) 2

Since the force increases linearly from 0 to kx, the (a)
average force Fy is given by:

O+kx 1
Fs eke akx (iii)
Substituting the value of Fay in Eq. (i) from Eq. (iii), we
get: Ww (Dk VP gk

As, this work is stored in spring as elastic potential
energy. Hence, the potential energy at any instant ‘x’
is given by:

(17.11) x=0

’ Figure 17.7: A vibrating mass-spring
system.

P.E = —kx?
2 x

At extreme position, where the displacement is
maximum, i.€. X = Xo, the block is at rest. So, its kinetic
energy is zero and total energy is entirely elastic potential energy, i.e.

T.E = PLE max = skx: (17.12)

When the block is released, it moves toward mean position. As a result, its velocity increases
and also its kinetic energy. However, the displacement of the block decreases and also its

elastic potential energy.
As, the instantaneous velocity v of the block executing SHM is given by,

v=o \x -x? ______ (iv)

As, ® = fe. so Eq. (iv) becomes:

r is 2_y2
v mm * x") (v)

At mean position x = 0, the block gets maximum velocity, i.e.,
Vo = fe Xo (vi)
Hence, at any instant where the displacement is ‘x’, the kinetic energy is given by!

K.E = inv? = kod -x*) (17.13)

National Book Foundation 17-Simple Harmonic Motion

--- PAGE 57 ---
At mean position (x = 0), the elastic potential energy is zero but the velocity is maximum, hence
the total energy is entirely kinetic energy.

T.E = K.E max * SMV = xk x?
Let us now examine the total energy of the systems at displacement x. As, the total energy is
the sum of kinetic and potential energy, i.e.

T.E =K.E + P.E (vii)
After substituting the values of K.E and P.E from Eq. (17.11) and Eq. (17.13) in Eq. (vii), we
get:

(17.14)

RE Sk(xS -x*) + okx? . sx:

(17.15)

As, W = fe. or k = m w?, so Eq. (17.15) can also be
written as:

T.E= imu"; (17.16)

From Eqs. (17.12), (17.14) and (17.15), it is proved that:

Total energy of the mass-spring system is constant and is
proportional to square of the amplitude of oscillation.

This statement of conservation of energy is equally valid
for all bodies executing SHM.

The energy oscillates between K.E and P.E, but their sum

remains constant. This can be illustrated by plotting the me, " Ney paid ene pore
graph of K.E, P.E and T.E verses displacement, as shown displacement, for SHM.

17.8 FREE, FORCED AND DAMPED OSCILLATIONS

Depending upon the situation, oscillations may be damped, free and forced oscillations. Here
we discuss these three types of oscillations in detail.

Free Oscillations

Every oscillator has a natural frequency of vibration with
which it vibrates freely after an initial disturbance. For
example, an ideal simple pendulum oscillates freely with its
natural frequency, when slightly displaced from its mean
position, as shown in Fig.17.8 (a). The natural frequency of
pendulum depends on its length. If you change the length of
string, you may change its natural frequency.
If you pluck a guitar string, it continues to vibrate for some ©)
time after you have released it. It vibrates with its natural -
frequency and it gives rise to the particular note that you Figure’17.8 (a): Illustration of
hear. The natural frequency of guitar string depends on its free oscillation.
length. If you change the length of string, certainly you
change its natural frequency.

A body is said to be executing free oscillations when it oscillates under the influence of a

restoring force without any external force acting on it.

The free oscillations possess constant amplitude and period without any external force acts on
it. Ideally, free oscillations do not undergo damping.

Forced Oscillations

If an external force acts on an oscillator, it can change its amplitude of oscillations. The
external force shifts the energy to the oscillator at a certain frequency, not necessarily the
same as the natural frequency of the oscillator. This frequency is called driven frequency.

National Book Foundation 17-Simple Harmonic Motion

=3

--- PAGE 59 ---
For example, when you push a swing, you have to keep periodically
pushing it so that the it doesn’t reduce its amplitude and continue
oscillating. These oscillations are called forced oscillations.

If the external forces make the object to oscillate at the frequency of
applied force rather than its natural frequency, then such oscillations
are called forced oscillations.

Movement of the pendulum of a clock (as shown in Fig.17.8-b) is also
an example of a forced oscillations, because it is driven by a small
motor.

Figure 17.8 (b):
Damped Oscillations Illustration of force
—————— Ss oscillation.

Damping is the effect of resistive forces which dissipate energy from a

vibrating object. When a simple pendulum is being set into oscillatory motion, then after some
time, it stops oscillating due to air resistance. All oscillating systems experience such type
of resistive force which are known as damping forces. Due to the damping force, amplitude of
oscillation decreases over time from one oscillation to the next and eventually stops oscillating.

Examples of damping forces can include frictional forces between moving parts, air resistance
or internal forces such as those in springs that tend

to dissipate energy as heat. Displacement
We know that in reality, a spring won't oscillate
forever. Frictional forces will diminish the Time

amplitude of oscillations until eventually the
system comes to rest.

If the amplitude of oscillations decreases under
damping forces, then such oscillations are called Figure 17.9 (a): Displacement-time
damped oscillations. graphs to illustrate undamped oscillations.

It can also be defined as: when an oscillator undergoes oscillations before coming to rest under
the action of damping force, then such oscillations are called damped oscillations. As an

oscillator vibrates, it performs work against force of friction, which result in the gradually
decrease of oscillator’s energy.

The damping is said to be light when the amplitude of oscillations decreases gradually with
time.

Light damping gradually reduces the energy and amplitude of the vibrating object. An example
of ‘light damping’ is a swing in playground, which gradually comes to rest when oscillates freely.
Displacement-time graph of light damping is shown in Fig. 17.9 (a) by black curve.

Heavy damping takes long time before the object comes to rest; it is shown in Fig. 17.9 (b) by
green curve.

In heavy damping, the oscillator merely moves back to its equilibrium position gradually without
completing a single oscillation. It is the result of a very large resistive force.

Modern auto suspensions are set up so that all of a spring’s energy is absorbed by the shock

bouncing.

17.9 RESONANCE

ane aeehie
A driving force is always required to initiate the oscillations of any oscillator, damped or un-
damped, by supplying the initial energy for the motion. The driving forces have their own

frequencies, which cause the oscillator to vibrate at the driving frequency rather than at the
natural frequency.

When the frequency of driving force gradually increases from zero, the oscillator begins to
vibrate with small amplitude. As we increase the frequency, the amplitude of vibration also
increases. The closer the deriving frequency to the natural frequency, the more efficiently the
driving force transfers energy to the oscillator and the greater the resulting amplitude. When
the deriving frequency equals the natural frequency of oscillator, the amplitude of vibrations
reaches to its maximum value, this situation is called resonance. Hence resonance is defined
as:

‘
Resonance is the phenomena in which the amplitude of y .

vibration of an oscillator attains maximum value when
deriving frequency becomes equal to the natural frequency
of oscillator. The natural frequency of the oscillator is
called resonance frequency.

At resonance frequency, the efficiency of energy transfer
from the driving force to the oscillator is maximum. This
can be demonstrated with a simple experiment, as shown
in Fig. 17.10. Here the five pendulums A, B, C, D and E are ,

resonance peak and larger amplitude. While heavy damping, decreases the amplitude.

In practical applications, such as car’s suspension system, heavy damping is employed to

Applications of Resonance in Daily Life

Resonance plays very important role in various phenomena of daily life. Here we shall discuss

some circumstances in which resonance is useful:

Tuning of Radio and Electrical Resonance: When we turn the knob of a radio to tune
a station. We are actually changing the natural frequency of the electrical circuit of receiver
to make it equal to the transmission frequency of the radio station. When the two
frequencies match with €ach other, then resonance occurs. In this way, energy absorption
from the station is maximum and this is the only station we hear.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used medical
diagnostic tool in which atomic nuclei (mostly hydrogen nuclei) are made to oscillate by
incoming strong radio waves (on the order of 100 MHz). When resonance occurs, maximum
energy is absorbed by the nuclei. The pattern of energy absorbed can be used to produce
computer enhanced photography.

Heating/Cooking of Food in Microwave Ovens and Resonance: In a microwave oven,
the microwave with a frequency similar to the natural frequency of vibration of water or
fat molecules are used. When the food is placed in the oven, the water molecules in the
food oscillate by absorbing maximum energy from the microwaves. Hence, it causes the
food to heat up for cooking. The plastic or glass containers do not heat up in ovens, since
they do not contain water molecules.

Resonance in Guitar: When the guitarist strikes the guitar strings, a vibration is produced.
The vibration transmits to the hollow wooden box. Thus, creating resonance, and the sound
gets amplified.

Following are some circumstances in which resonance should

be avoided:

Resonance in Bridge: Soldiers while marching on the
bridge are ordered to break their steps. This is because
that the vibrations created by the rhythmic march on the
bridge cause the bridge to oscillate with its natural
frequency. Thus, amplitude of vibrations increases and
resonance occurs that causes the bridge to collapse. One
of the most studied examples of this is the collapse of [sam
Tacoma Narrows Bridge, as shown in Fig. 17.12. The Figure 17,12; Collapse of

e Resonance in Airplane’s Wing: The wing is a very flexible part of the airplane. If the
periodic vibrations of the wind gust have a frequency equal to the natural structural
frequency of the wing, resonance occurs. At resonance, the arnplified vibrations of the wing
become too large. It eventually leads to its destruction. To avoid resonance, it is important
to design the wing such that the natural frequency of the wing does not match the external
frequencies of vibrations.

amplitude, it shatters the glass.

Applications of Resonance and Standing Waves

There are many applications of resonance in different devices that generate and use standing
waves. Some of them are discussed here:

Rubens Tubes: A Rubens tube (also bbe: etbtes ethan. oudspeaker
known as a standing wave flame tube)
is used to demonstrate
acoustic standing waves. It consists of
a metal pipe with holes drilled along
the top and sealed at both ends. One
sealed end is attached to a small
speaker or frequency generator while
the other end is connecter to a supply
of a flammable gas, as shown in Fig. Figure 17.13: Rubens tube setup.
17.13. The pipe is filled with the gas,

and the gas leaking from the perforations produces a resonant flame.

When sound waves of resonance frequency (based on the tube
dimensions) is produced by frequency generator, a standing wave
formed inside the tube. The standing wave creates points with
oscillating (higher and lower) pressure within the tube. Less gas will
escape from the perforations in the tube where pressure is low, hence
the flames will be lower at these points. Large quantity of gas will
escape. from the perforations in the tube where pressure is high, hence
the flames will be high at these points. The wavelength of the standing
wave can be determined with a ruler by measuring the distance
between low and high flame. Figure 17.14:

Acoustic levitation.

Acoustic Levitation: Acoustic levitation is a method for suspending
matter in air against gravity by using acoustic pressure from high intensity sound waves, as
shown in Fig 17.14. Acoustic levitation provides a container-less environment for some
experiments. Acoustic levitation occurs when sound waves interact and create a standing wave
with nodes that can trap a particle.

Chladni Plates: A chladni plate consists of a flat metal sheet (usually circular or square)
mounted on a central stalk attached to a strong base. When the plate oscillates in a particular
mode of vibration, the nodes and antinodes that formed produce a complex but symmetrical
patterns on its surface. The positions of these nodes and antinodes can be seen by sprinkling
sand upon the plates. The sand will vibrate away from the antinodes and gather at the nodes.

It is a good demonstration to show how complicated modes of vibration can be formed on the chladni
plates of different shapes and dimensions.

SUMMARY

“ When a body moves to and fro about its mean position, then such motion is called vibratory
or oscillatory motion.

% The complete round trip of an oscillating or vibrating body about its mean position is called
oscillation or vibration.

The distance of vibrating body from the equilibrium position on either side at any instant
of time is known as displacement. Its S! unit.is meter.

The maximum displacement of a vibrating body from mean position is called amplitude. Its
SI unit is meter.

The time taken to complete one oscillation or vibration is called time period of the
oscillation. It is denoted by T. Its SI unit is second.

The number of vibrations or oscillations per unit time is called frequency.

SHM is an oscillatory motion in which acceleration of a particle is directly proportional to
its displacement from the mean position and is always directed towards the mean position.

When a body moves in a circle, its projection undergoes simple harmonic motion on the
diameter of the circle.

The angle which specifies the displacement as well as the direction of a point executing
SHM is called phase of the motion.

Energy of a body executing SHM remains conserved. The energy oscillates between K.E and
P.E, but their sum remains constant.

A body is said to be executing free oscillation when it oscillates under the influence of
restoring force without any external force acting on it.

If the external forces make the object oscillating at the frequency of applied force rather
than its natural frequency, then such oscillations are called forced oscillations.

If the amplitude of oscillations decreases under damping forces, then such oscillations are
called damped oscillations.

The damping is said to be light when the amplitude of oscillations decreases gradually with
time.

When an oscillator comes to rest without any oscillation in the shortest time under a
damping force, then such damping is called critical damping.

Resonance is the phenomena in which the amplitude of vibration of an oscillator attains
maximum value when deriving frequency equals the natural frequency of oscillator.

A Rubens tube is used for demonstrating acoustic standing waves.

Acoustic levitation is a method for suspending matter in air against gravity by using acoustic
pressure from high intensity sound waves.

--- PAGE 71 ---
Have you ever marveled at the vibrant colors of a rainbow, or wondered why sound waves can
sometimes cancel each other out, creating silence? These phenomena are a testament to two
fascinating wave properties: interference and diffraction.

Interference occurs when two or more waves traveling through the same medium interact and
superimpose on each other. This interaction can lead to surprising results. Depending on how
the waves are aligned, they can either strengthen each other (constructive interference),
creating brighter light or louder sound, or cancel each other out (destructive interference),
resulting in darkness or quieter sound. Understanding interference allows us to explain everyday
occurrences like the beating sound between slightly off-tune instruments and the formation of
colorful bands in soap bubbles. Interference isn't limited to light or sound waves. It’s a
fundamental property observed in all types of waves, from water ripples in a tank to the
intricate quantum waves that make up matter. So, the next time you witness a dazzling rainbow
or hear a mesmerizing musical chord, remember, it's all a captivating play of interference.

Diffraction, on the other hand, describes the bending of a wave around the edges of an obstacle
or through a narrow slit. Unlike reflection, where a wave bounces off a surface, diffraction
causes the wave to spread out and travel into regions beyond the obstacle’s shadow. This
phenomenon is responsible for the dazzling colors we see in rainbows, where sunlight diffracts
through water droplets. Diffraction also plays a crucial role in various technologies like x-ray
crystallography, which helps us understand the structure of materials, and optical instruments
like diffraction gratings, which separate light into its constituent colors.

Interference and diffraction are not isolated concepts; they are intimately connected. Both
phenomena arise from the wave nature of tight, sound, and other waves. While interference
describes how waves interact and superimpose, diffraction showcases how waves can bend and
spread out when encountering obstacles. Understanding these principles unveils a deeper
understanding of the behavior of waves and their remarkable effects in the world around us.

18.1 INTERFERENCE ie e he

Two-source interference, also known as
double-slit interference, is a phenomenon
in which waves from two coherent sources
overlap and interfere with each other,
creating a pattern of alternating
constructive and destructive interference
fringes. Interference of two waves may
lead to a resultant wave of either a larger
or a_ smaller displacement. This
phenomenon can be demonstrated using Figure 18.1: Interference of water waves.
various types of waves, including water

waves ina ripple tank (see Fig. 18.1), sound waves, light waves, and microwaves.

Conditions for Observing Interference Fringes:
To observe interference fringes in a two-source setup, the following conditions must be met:

National Book Foundation () 18-Diffraction and Interference

--- PAGE 72 ---
1. Coherent Sources: The two sources emitting the waves must be coherent, meaning they
have a constant phase relationship and emit waves with the same frequency and

wavelength.

2. Narrow Slits: The slits must be narrow and close together compared to the wavelength of
the waves. This ensures that the waves from each slit overlap and interfere with each other.

3. Monochromatic Waves: The waves emitted by the sources should ideally have a single
wavelength (monochromatic) to produce a clear interference pattern.

4. Stable Environment: The experimental setup must be free from disturbances such as
vibrations or air currents, which could disrupt the wave patterns and interfere with the

observation of fringes.

By satisfying these conditions, two-source interference fringes can be observed across various
wave types, demonstrating the wave nature of light, sound, and other phenomena.

18.1.1 Interference of Water Waves

Interference can be demonstrated in a ripple
tank by using two-point:sources. In a ripple tank
experiment (see Fig. 18:2), two coherent
sources are created by generating ripples in the
water from two separate point sources. The tank
is illuminated from above to enhance visibility.
When the waves from both sources meet, they
interfere with each other. This interference
creates regions of constructive interference,
where waves reinforce each other and produce
larger waves, and regions of destructive
interference, where waves cancel each other
out. This results in a pattern of alternating crest
and trough on the surface of the water.

Interference of two circular waves is shown
in Fig. 18.3. If two waves arrive in phase (their crests or
trough arrive at exactly the same time), they will
interfere constructively. A resultant wave will be
produced, which has crests much higher than the two
individual waves, and troughs much deeper.

lf the two waves arrive in anti-phase (with a phase
difference of nm radians or 180°), the peaks of one wave
arrive at the same time as the troughs from the other, and
they will interfere destructively. The resultant wave will
have smaller amplitude. This phase difference may be
produced by allowing the two sets of waves to travel
different distances. This difference in distance of travel is

called the path difference.

18.1.2 Interference of Sound Waves

Similar to water waves, sound waves
can also exhibit interference. Two
speakers emitting coherent sound
waves are placed facing a screen, as
shown in Fig 18.4. The sound waves
from both sources overlap, creating
regions of constructive and
destructive interference. This
interference pattern can be
visualized by using a microphone or a
detector to measure the intensity of
sound at various points on the
screen.

Consider sound waves from two loudspeakers connected to the same signal generator and
amplifier, producing notes of the same frequency. Sound waves being longitudinal waves,
consists of compressions and rarefactions. At points such as P;, Ps, Ps, Pe and Ps constructive
interference occurs because here compressions or rarefactions align and the sound appears
louder. Destructive interference occurs at points such as P2, P3, P7 and Ps, when compression
align with a rarefaction and vice versa, resulting in a quieter sound. This principle is used in
noise-cancelling headphones (you have studied in grade XI).

18.1.3 Interference of Light Waves

In a double-slit experiment with light waves,.a laser
beam is typically used as the coherent light source. The
light beam is directed through a barrier with two narrow
slits (Figure 18.5), creating two coherent sources of light
waves. A screen placed behind the slits displays the
interference pattern. The pattern consists of alternating
bright and dark fringes, which can be observed directly
or captured using a camera. Here, light of a single
wavelength passes through a pair of vertical slits and
produces a diffraction pattern on the screen—numerous
vertical bright and dark lines that are spread out
horizontally. Without diffraction and interference, the

of closely spaced vertical slits (the double slit) through which light passes. Initially, Young

light partially coherent (waves with a definite phase relationship). He then directed this
partially coherent light through the double slit. The light passes through two narrow slits,
producing semicircular waves that overlap and interfere on a screen placed behind the slits.

As the two slits (S; and S2) are narrow, so the light spreads out (diffracts) from each slit, as

shown in Fig. 18.6 (a). Two slits provide two coherent light sources that interfere and

interference fringes will be obtained in the form of bright (constructive interference) and dark

(destructive interference) pattern on the screen, as shown in the Fig. 18.6 (b).

Figure 18.6 (c) shows that the double-slit
interference pattern for water waves is
nearly identical to that for light. Young's use
of sunlight in his double-slit experiment
made the effect easier to observe. This is
because sunlight is a mixture of different
wavelengths (colors), and each wavelength
formed its own interference pattern on the
screen. To observe clear _ pattern,
monochromatic (single-wavelength) light is
often used:

proportional to the path difference between the waves which can be expressed in terms of the
wavelength ‘A’ of the wave.

If ‘d’ is the separation distance between the slits, ‘L’ is distance between the slits and the
screen, and ‘y’ is the distance from the central maximum to the point ‘P’ on the screen. Then
from the AABC: ~ sin@ = oe or BC = AB sin

Hence, the path difference BC between the waves reaching a point on the screen from the two
slits is:

Path difference = d sin6 (18.1)
Constructive Interference: Light waves show constructive interference when their crests
(peaks) overlap, leading to a bright maximum on the screen. This occurs when the path
difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength, i.e.,

Path difference = mA
Where m is an integer (0, +1, +2, +3, ...) representing the order of the maxima (central maxima
is 0" order). When m = +1, then two bright fringes are obtained one above and one below the
central point O, which are called 1* order bright fringes, and so on.
Destructive Interference: Destructive interference happens when the crests of one wave

cancel out the troughs of another, resulting in a dark fringe called minima. This occurs when
the path difference is an odd multiple of half the wavelength, i.e.,

18.1.4 _ Interference of Microwaves

Microwaves can also be used to demonstrate two-source interference. Two-source interference
experiments using microwaves are a fascinating demonstration of wave physics. These
experiments typically involve two coherent microwave sources, i.e. microwaves of the same
frequency and phase. When these microwaves overlap, they create an interference pattern
characterized by alternating regions of constructive and destructive interference.

To observe this pattern, a detector is moved through the various points of interference,
registering the intensity of the microwaves. At points of constructive interference, the detector
records a higher intensity, while at points of destructive interference, the intensity is
significantly lower or even zero. This pattern can be visualized on a screen or through a
recording device connected to the detector.

Experimental setup: One common setup for such an experiment includes a microwave
transmitter and a receiver, as shown in Fig 18.8. The transmitter emits microwaves towards

two slits or openings, which then act as the new sources of waves. As the waves emanate from

Nationa! Book Foundation 18-Diffraction and Interference

--- PAGE 77 ---
these slits, they overlap and interfere with each other. The receiver, which is placed at variable
distances and angles from the slits, measures the intensity of the resulting microwaves.
The data collected from these experiments can be used to calculate the wavelength of the
microwaves, as the distance between the points of maximum or minimum intensity is related
to the wavelength and the geometry of the setup. This is a practical application of the principles
of wave superposition and interference.
These experiments not only demonstrate the wave nature of microwaves but also have practical
implications. For instance, understanding microwave interference is crucial in designing
microwave communication systems to avoid signal loss due to destructive interference.
Moreover, the principles observed in microwave interference are analogous to those in other
wave phenomena, including sound waves, water waves, and even quantum mechanics, where
particles exhibit wave-like behavior. Thus, two-source interference experiments with
microwaves provide a valuable insight into the broader wave phenomena that govern various
aspects of the physical world.
Example 18.1: The fringe spacing between the central maxima and 1* minima is 2 mm. If a
light of 500 mm is used then find the separation between the slits. The distance between
the slit and screen is 1 m.
Given: Distance between central maximum and 1* minimum y; = 2.0 mm = 0.002 m

Wavelensth of light A = 500 nm = 5.00 x 107 m

Distance between the slits and screen L = 1.0m
To Find: Slit separation = d =?
Solution: We can use the relationship between fringe spacing and slit separation, as:

y=m d

For 1* minima, put m = 1, so we get: y= *

Rearranging the equation to solve ford, we get: d= =

Therefore, the separation between the slits is about 250 micrometers.

18.2 DIFFRACTION G

A diffraction grating is an optical device consisting of a transparent
material, such as glass or plastic, having a large number of equally
spaced parallel slits or grooves etched or ruled over it, as shown in Fig.

The distance between two adjacent slits is called grating element. .

Grating element is represented by d, and can be calculated by using the following formula:
unit length of grating
° total number of lines ruled on it
Grating element is typically of the order of the wavelength of light or smaller. The number of
slits per unit length, denoted by "N,” determines the resolving power of the diffraction grating.

18.2.1 Diffraction of Light through Diffraction Grating

The principle behind using a diffraction grating, to determine the wavelength of light, is based
on the interference pattern produced when light passes through the grating. When
monochromatic light (light of a :

single wavelength) illuminates a
diffraction grating, the light
waves passing through the slits
interfere constructively and
destructively, creating a pattern
of bright and dark fringes, as
‘shown in Fig. 18.9 (b).

The angle at which the bright
fringes (maxima) occur depends
on the wavelength of light and
the spacing between the slits in
the grating. This relationship is
described by the equation:
dsin@=mA Figure 18.9 (b): Diffraction of light through diffraction grating.

By measuring the angle of diffraction (6) for a specific order of the bright fringe (m) and
knowing the spacing between the slits (d), one can determine the wavelength of light (A).

By following this procedure, the wavelength of light can be accurately determined using a
diffraction grating, making it a valuable tool in spectroscopy and various scientific applications.

An idealized graphs of the intensity of light passing through a double slit and a diffraction
grating for monochromatic light is shown in Fig.18.10. Maxima can be produced at the same

angles, but those for the

Quantum Mechenics

The Electron Double Slit Experiment is a classic physics experiment that demonstrates the
principles of wave-particle duality and the nature of reality at the quantum level.

patterns on the screen, corresponding.to the

two slits. However, the actual outcome is an interference pattern, similar to what we would
expect from waves. This suggests that electrons exhibit wave-like behavior.

The Electron Double Slit Experiment has far-reaching implications for our understanding of
reality, including:

« Quantum mechanics: It laid the foundation for quantum mechanics, which describes the
behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level.

¢ Limits of classical physics: It showed that classical physics is insufficient to describe the
behavior of particles at the quantum level.

e Philosophical implications: It raises questions about the nature of reality, observation,
and the role of the observer in shaping reality.

The electron double-slit experiment has led to several interpretations of quantum mechanics.
The two prominent interpretations in this context are Copenhagen interpretation and many-
worlds interpretation.

i) Copenhagen Interpretation

The Copenhagen Interpretation (Cl) is a widely-held interpretation of quantum mechanics that
was formulated by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. it states that a quantum system, like an
electron before measurement, doesn't possess a definite position or momentum. Instead, it
exists in a superposition of all possible states simultaneously. Here's how Cl explains the

Electron Double Slit Experiment:

e Before detection, the electron is considered to be in a superposition of states, passing
through both slits simultaneously (wave-like behavior).

National Book Foundation (20 ) 18-Diffraction and Interference

--- PAGE 81 ---
\ ews

« The act of measurement (detecting the electron on the screen) forces the wave function to
collapse into a definite position, explaining why we see a single electron hit at a specific
POINT ON the screen (particie-like Denavior).

e The interference pattern observed on the screen arises from the probability distribution of
where the electron might be detected. Regions with higher probability density correspond
to bright fringes, while regions with lower probability density correspond to dark fringes.

Criticisms:

e° The “collapse of the wave function” due to measurement seems like an arbitrary break from
the deterministic nature of physics. ,

e It doesn't explain what happens to the “other possibilities” in the superposition before
measurement.

The Copenhagen Interpretation remains a widely-held and influential interpretation of quantum
mechanics, but its implications and limitations continue to be debated among physicists and
philosophers.

ii) Many-Worlds Interpretation

The many-worlds interpretation, proposed by Hugh Everett III in 1957, presents a radically
different view of quantum mechanics. It proposes that every interaction in the quantum realm
splits the universe into multiple realities (worids), one for each possible outcome. Each branch
of reality carries forward one possibility from the superposition. Here's how many-worlds
interpretation explains the Electron Double Slit Experiment: R

e The electron initially exists in a superposition, going through both slits-in all the newly
created worlds.

« Ineach world, the electron interacts with the detector screen and leaves its mark (particle-
like behavior) at a specific location.

e The interference pattern observed on the screen is a reflection of the combined effect of
electrons hitting the screen in all the parallel universes. We only experience one world (the
one where the electron interacted with our detector}, but the interference pattern signifies
the existence of the other possibilities.

Criticisms:

e The concept of multiple universes is difficult to test experimentally.

e It doesn't provide a clear explanation of the transition from superposition to a definite state
upon measurement.

Both the Copenhagen and Many-Worids interpretations are attempts to explain the puzzling
behavior of quantum systems at the microscopic level. Neither interpretation is universally
accepted, and physicists continue to debate their implications. While the experiment
demonstrates the wave-particle duality, the underlying reality behind it remains an ongoing
exploration in quantum mechanics.

SUMMARY

*% Interference: The interaction of two or more waves propagating through the same medium,

resulting in a superposition effect that can lead to constructive or destructive interference.

* Constructive Interference: When the crests (peaks) of two or more waves overlap, they

>

reinforce each other, producing a resultant wave with a higher intensity (brighter light,
louder sound) compared to the individual waves.

* Destructive Interference: When the crest of one wave coincides with the trough (valley)

of another wave, they cancel each other out partially or completely. This results in a weaker
resultant wave with a lower intensity (darkness, quieter sound) compared to the individual
waves.

Superposition Principle: A fundamental principle in wave physics stating that the resultant
wave at any point in space is the sum of the individual waves present at that point. The

‘individual waves can add up constructively or destructively depending on their relative

phases (alignment).

Coherent Sources: Waves that have the same frequency and a constant phase relationship
are considered coherent. This means the crests and troughs of the waves occur at the same
time, allowing for predictable interference patterns.

Wavelength (A): The distance between two consecutive crests (or troughs) of a wave.

Frequency (f): The number of wave cycles that pass a point in a given unit of time (usually
measured in Hertz or Hz).

Diffraction: The bending of a wave around the edges of an obstacle or through a narrow
slit. Unlike reflection, where the wave bounces off a surface, diffraction causes the wave
to spread out and travel into regions beyond the geometrical shadow of the obstacle.

Wave front: A surface connecting points in a wave that are in the same phase (at the same
point in their cycle). In diffraction, the wave front is altered as it interacts with the
diffracting object.

Slit Width: The width of the opening through which the wave passes in diffraction. The
smaller the slit width compared to the wavelength, the more pronounced the diffraction
effect will be.

Diffraction Grating: A periodic structure with many closely spaced parallel slits or grooves.
When light or other waves pass through a diffraction grating, they diffract and create a
specific pattern of diffracted beams due to constructive and destructive interference.

Diffraction Pattern: The spatial distribution of intensity observed after a wave diffracts
around an obstacle or through a slit. This pattern typically consists of alternating bright and
dark bands due to constructive and destructive interference of the diffracted waves.

Grating Constant (d): The distance between the centers of two adjacent slits (or grooves)
in a diffraction grating. The grating constant plays a crucial role in determining the angles
at which the diffracted beams emerge.

Copenhagen interpretation emphasizes indeterminism, complementarity, and the role of
measurement, while the many-worlds interpretation posits a multitude of parallel
universes where all quantum outcomes coexist.

19.1 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL ENERGY AND ELECTRIC POTENTIAL

Electricity is a form of energy that powers our devices and gadgets. Electric circuits usually use
electric energy and transfer it to other forms like heat, light, or motion. The stored energy of
an electric circuit is called electric potential energy. For example, we know that great amounts
of electrical energy can be stored in batteries, are transmitted cross-country through power
lines. Batteries are typically a few volts, the outlets in your home produce 220 volts, and power
lines can be as high as hundreds of thousands of volts. Energy and voltage are two different
quantities. A motorcycle battery, for example, is small and would not be very successful in
replacing the much larger car battery, yet each has the same voltage. Here, we shall examine
the relationship between voltage and electrical energy and begin to explore some of the many
applications of electricity.

Consider a point charge q is placed in between two
oppositely charged parallel plates, as shown in Fig. 19.1.
Force F experienced by the charge qp in the electric field E
is:

F=qeE

If the charge q, is allowed to move freely in an electric field,
it will move from positive plate to negative plate and acquire : :
kinetic energy. If the charge is moved against the electric 6000000090
field, energy is required. Figure 19.1: A charge is placed
Electric potential energy is the energy that is needed to pecan thee oppositely charged
move a charge against an electric field.

One needs more energy to move a charge further in the electric field, but also more energy to
move it through a stronger electric field. So, there are two factors on which the electric
potential energy of an object depends: Its own electric charge and its relative position with
other electrically charged objects.

Thus, the electric potential energy can also be defined as:

National Book Foundation 19-Electric Potential and Capacitor

--- PAGE 88 ---
Electric potential energy is the energy possessed by a unit charge if located at any point in the
space, around a field charge.

The change in potential energy AU of charge q. is equal to the “work done by the force in
carrying the charge q. from point B to the point A against the electrical field” i.e.,

AU = Wea

or Ua - Us = Waa (19.1)

Where Us, and Usrepresent the potential energies at point A and B respectively. Waa is the work
done by the force in carrying a positive charge q from point B to point A without disturbing the
equilibrium state of the charge. Unit of electric potential energy is joule ( J ).

The concept of electric potential is used to express the effect of an electric field of a source
in terms of the location within the electric field. A test charge with twice the quantity of charge
would possess twice the potential energy at a given location; yet its electric potential at that
location would be the same as any other test charge. A positive test charge would be at a high
electric potential when held close to a positive source charge and at a lower electric potential
when held further away. In this sense, electric potential becomes simply a property of the
location within an electric field. Suppose that the electric potential at a given location is 12
Joules per coulomb, then that is the electric potential of a 1 coulomb or a 2 coulomb charged
object. Stating that the electric potential at a given location is 12 joules per coulomb, would
mean that a 2 coulomb object would possess 24 joules of potential energy at that location and
a 0.5 coulomb object would experience 6 joules of potential energy at the location. Thus,
Electric potential is purely location dependent. Electric potential is the potential energy per
unit charge.

The potential difference between two points is defined as:

Potential difference is the work done in moving a unit positive charge from one point to another
keeping the charge in electrostatic equilibrium.

If Va and Ves are the electric potentials at points A and B, respectively, then the potential
difference between these two points is
AV = V,-V— = Wan = 4U (19.2)
GW %

It can also be written as:
AU = qoAV

Unit of Electric Potential

The unit of electric potential is joule per coulomb (J/C ) or volt ( V ).

The potential difference between two points in an electric field is one volt if one joule of
work is done in moving one coulomb of charge from one point to the other.

(19.3)

So, 1 volt = _joule_
coulomb

The following multiples and sub-multiples of volt are commonly used;

Example 19.1: You have a 12.0 Y motorcycle battery that can move 5000 C of charge, and
a 12.0 V car battery that can move 60,000 C of charge. How much energy does each deliver?

19.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL DUE TO A POINT CHARGE

The equation of electric potential AV in constant electric field E is given by:

AV=-—EA4r
This equation is true only for constant electric field E. For most of the cases electric field is not
uniform. Here we derive an expression of electric potential for such non uniform field. Let us suppose
an isolated charge +Q is placed at origin of coordinate system, as shown in Fig. 19.2.

7 N-3 N-2 N-1 N
4r

Figure 19.2: A test charge q is moved from a far point N to a point 1 against electric
field E.

Let a test charge q is moved from a far point N to a point 1 against electric field E by applying
force F. As the electric field does not remain constant but varies with the square of the distance
from the charge +Q. So, we divide this large distance into small steps of length Ar such that E

--- PAGE 90 ---
remains constant over each step. Here f,, fp, f,---, | are the distances of point 1, 2, 3, ...,.N
from charge Q, respectively. Let us find the electric potential from N to N—1.

The work done during the 1* step from N to N—1 is;
AW, ,y.1= F Ar cos®

As F=q E, so we get;

19.3 CAPACITORS

Capacitors are a common component in most electronic
devices: These are used to store energy. Typically,
commercial capacitors have two identical, parallel
conducting plates separated by a distance d, as shown in
Fig. 19.3, iscalleda parallel plate capacitor. The medium
between the plates is air or a sheet of some insulator.

This. medium is known as dielectric. When battery | Battery

charge, +Q and -Q, are separated into its two plates. The
Capacitor remains neutral overall, but we refer to it as —, Ps . Sepa
storing a charge Q in this circumstance. When a charge is

‘National Book Foundation 19-Electric Potential and Capacitor

--- PAGE 92 ---
transferred to one of the plates say (A) due to electrostatic induction it would induce charge Q
on the inner surface of the other plate (B). Mutual attraction between the charges keeps them
bound on the inner surface of two plates and thus the charge remains stored in the capacitor
even after removal of the battery.

Capacitance of a Capacitor

Experimentally it is seen that the charge stored on a capacitor is directly proportional to the
voltage applied across it. If a charge ‘Q’ is transferred to one of the plates of a capacitor when
the potential difference applied between the plates is ‘V’, then

QaVv
or Q=cV
Be

or Cc v (19.6)

Where ‘C’ is a constant of proportionality, called the capacitance of capacitor. Capacitance
can be defined as:

The capability of a capacitor to store charges is called its capacitance.

The unit of capacitance is the farad (F), named for Michael Faraday (1791-1867), an English
scientist who contributed to the fields of electromagnetism and electrochemistry. Since
capacitance is charge per unit voltage, we see that a farad is a coulomb per volt.

If a capacitor stores a charge of 1 coulomb (a Very large amount of charge) having the potential
difference of 1 volt between the plates, then the capacitance is called 1farad.

One farad is, thus, a very large capacitance. Typical capacitors range from picofarad (1 pF =
10° F) to millifarad (1 mF = 10° F).

Capacitance of a Parallel Plate Capacitor

Consider a parallel plate capacitor connected to a voltage source, as shown in Fig. 19.4. Let
the area of each plate is A and the separation between plates is d. It built +Q and -Q charges
on the plates. If the positive plate is at potential V; and negative plate is at potential V2, then
the electric field strength E between the plates is:

AV__ (V2-V4)_ Vy-Ve

Es —~-——=--4—t

Ar d d

Ex ‘ (i) (-Vi- V2 = V)

Where, d is separation between the plates. The strength of the electric field also depends on
the number of charges on the plates. As, Q is the charge on either of the plate of area A, so
the surface charge density on the plate is:

Q

o=—

Also, as the electric field intensity E between the plates of MaterialiScience and

The ratio of the capacitance of a capacitor with the dielectric medium between the plates to that
of the capacitance of the same capacitor when the space is evacuated is called the relative
permittivity €, of the material.

The equation Cmes = Aah shows that value of capacitance C depends upon:

¢ The area of the plates.
* The distance between the plates.
¢ The medium (dielectric) between the plates.

Example 19.2: What is the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor with metal plates, each

of area 1.00 m’, separated by 1.00 mm? What charge is stored in this capacitor if a voltage
of 3.00 x 10? V is applied to it?

Given: Area of the plate = A = 1.00 m?

Entering the given values into the equation, we get:
C = (1.00)(8.85x10") +1.00x107

or C = 8.85x10° F = 8.85 nF
b) Now the charge stored in the capacitor can be found by the equation: Q= C V
Entering the known values into this equation gives:

Q = (8.85x10°*)(3.00x10*) = 26.6 pC

19.4 COMBINATIONS OF CAPACITORS

Several capacitors can be Connected together to be used in a variety of applications. Multiple
connections of capacitors behave as a single equivalent capacitor. The total capacitance of this
equivalent single capacitor depends both on the individual capacitors and how they are
connected. Capacitors can be arranged in two simple and common types of connections, known
as series and parallel combinations.

energy, and it is thus related to the charge ‘Q’ and
voltage ‘V’ on the capacitor. The capacitor starts
with zero voltage and gradually comes up to its full
voltage as it is charged. The first charge placed on
a capacitor experiences a change in voltage AV = 0,
since the capacitor has zero voltage when Energy stored
uncharged. The final charge placed on a capacitor in Capacitor
experiences AV = V, since the capacitor now has its

potential difference is therefore a straight-
line graph through the origin, as shown in the Fig. 19.6.

The electric potential energy (E) stored in a capacitor can be determined from the area under
the potential-charge graph which is equal to the area of a right-angled triangle:

E = area of a right-angled triangle OAB

19.6 CHARGING AND DISCHARGING OF A CAPACITOR

Consider an RC (resistor-capacitor) circuit for charging of a capacitor, as shown in.Fig. 19.7 (a).
When the switch is set at point 1, a battery of e.m.f ‘e’ starts charging the capacitor through ~
the resistor R: The charge builds up gradually on the plates to the maximum value of Q.

When a capacitor charges, electrons flow onto one plate and
move off the other plate. This process will be continued until
the potential difference across the capacitor is equal to the
e.m.f of the battery.

The rate of flow of charge will not be linear. At the start, the
current will be at its highest value but will gradually decrease |
to zero. Voltage on the capacitor is initially zero and rises

rapidly at first, since the initial current is a maximum. Suppose Charai
at t = 0, charge on a capacitor is zero i.e. Q= 0. It can be shown current path

experimentally that after time t, as charge builds up on the
plates, it repels more charge that is arriving so the current Figure 19.7 (a): Charging

Bioelectricity ateex to the generation or action of electric currents or atau in biological
processes, Electric activity in living tissue is a cellular phenomenon that depends on the cell
membrane. The cell membrane acts like acapacitor that stores energy as electrically
charged ions on opposite sides of the cell membrane. .

In most solutions, ions of a given electric charge are accompanied by ions of opposite charge,
so that the solution itself has no net charge. If two solutions of different concentrations are
separated by a membrane that allows one kind of ion to pass but block the other, producing
equal and opposite net charges in the two solutions. This concentration imbalance gives rise to
an electric-potential difference between the solutions.

In living cells, there are two types of solutions: those found inside and outside the cell. The cell
membrane (as shown in Fig. 19.9), separating inside from outside, is semipermeable. Cell
membrane allows certain ions to pass through while blocking others. In particular, nerve-cell
and muscle-cell membranes are slightly permeable to positive potassium ions (K+), which
diffuse outward, leaving a net negative charge in the cell. lon channels allow specific inorganic
ions (such as: Na*, K*, Ca”, or Cl’) to diffuse rapidly down their electrochemical gradients across
the lipid bilayer. :

The bioelectric potential across a cell membrane is typically about 50 millivolts; this potential
is known as the resting potential. Bioelectric phenomena include fast signaling in nerves and
the triggering of physical processes in muscles or glands.

There are several species of aquatic life, such as Electrophorus Electricus, that can naturally
generate external electric shocks through internal biological mechanisms that act as batteries.

Such species are called electrogenic animals. Electric eels are probably the best
known electrogenic animals. Some types of bacteria, yeast and fish are also electrogenic.

There are also animals that can detect electricity. They’re called electroreceptive.
Some electroreceptive animals are echidnas, platypuses, bees, spiders, dolphins, sharks and
rays.
Most electrogenic animals are also electroreceptive. But there are many electroreceptive
animals that are not electrogenic.

Electric eelsare known for their ability to stun
their prey by generating electricity, delivering
shocks up to 860 volts.

The electric current used in electrical devices have two forms: Direct Current (DC) and
Alternating Current (AC). Direct current flows continuously in one direction while alternating
current changes its polarity at regular interval of time. The direction of alternating current at
any instant depends upon the polarity of the voltages. When an alternating voltage is applied
in a circuit, the current flows first in one direction and then in the opposite direction.

From the lights in your home to the smartphone in your pocket, alternating current (AC) plays
a vital role in powering our daily lives. It is the backbone of modern electricity, powering our
homes, industries, and technologies. But what makes AC so efficient and widely used? Have you
ever wondered how does it transmit power efficiently over long distances? What makes it
possible for us to use a wide range of electrical devices in our daily lives?

In this unit, we’ll discuss about alternating current and its behaviour with resistor, capacitor
and inductor. Through interactive examples, diagrams, and real-life applications, you'll gain a
deeper understanding of the principles and technologies that underlie our modern electrical
infrastructure. Get ready to unlock the secrets of alternating current and discover how it
powers the modern. world!

x = Xo. sin (at)

Where, x represents magnitude of alternating current or voltage corresponding to the time t,
and X. represents maximum value of alternating current or voltage. w represents the angular

frequency of generator and hence of current and voltage.

The graph of voltage or current against time is shown

alternating voltage/current can be produced by
rotating a coil with a constant angular velocity (w) in

a uniform magnetic field.

AC Terminologies

Some important A.C. terminology are defined below:

--- PAGE 108 ---
_ Cycle: One complete set of positive and negative values of an Pay Reece, TY
alternating quantity is known as a cycle. Figure 20.2 shows one | ecenanae — ae
cycle of an alternating voltage. _ Pakistan is 50 Hz,

Time Period (T); The time taken to complete one cycle of an alternating quantity is called
its time period.

Frequency (f); The number of cycles that occurs in one second is called the frequency of the
alternating quantity. It is measured in cycle/second or Hertz.

Average Value: The average value of a waveform is the average of all its values over a period
of time. Finding an average value over time means adding all the values that occur in a
specifying time interval and dividing the sum by that time.

The average value of a waveform from graph can be calculated by using the following formula:

Total(net)area under the curve for time T

Ave 7 =
veragenpny TimeT

The area above the time axis is taken as positive area and area below the time axis as negative
area. In order to specify a sinusoidal voltage or current we do not use averagé value, because
its value over one cycle is zero and cannot be used for power calculation.

Peak Value (xo); Maximum value of
alternating quantity (current or Peak value -
voltage) is called peak value, r.mus value
represents by xo. The peak value of a
sine wave occurs twice each cycle,
once at the positive maximum value
(Xo) and once at the negative
maximum value (-Xo).

Root-mean-square (r.m.s,) value:
The r.m.s value of an alternating
current is that steady current (d.c) vy 7
which when flowing through a resistor | Figure 20.2: r.m.s and peak va
produce the same amount of heat as “~~ ,
that produced by the alternating current when flowing through the same resistance for the
same time. The relation between root-mean-square (Xrms.) and peak: values (Xo) is given below:

r.m.s value for alternating current: Xems = Xo/ V2 .
The relation for current and voltage is “en ass :
r.m.s value for alternating current: = lo/V2 (20.2 a) 4
r.m.s value for alternating voltage: Vims = Vo/ V2 (20.2 b) “af

For example, if the effective or r.m.s value of an alternating'’current is 7 A, then the alternating
current will produce the same heating effect as that produced by 7 A direct current.

Assignment 20.1

The peak voltage of an ac supply is 320 V. What is the rms value of this voltage?

20.2 RECTIFICATION o:

Every electronic circuit needs a dc voltage for its functioning. This dc voltage has been obtained
from the ac supply. For this purpose, the ac supply voltage has to be reduced (stepped down)
first using a step-down transformer and then converted to dc by using a circuit called rectifier.

20-Alternating Current

--- PAGE 110 ---
The process of converting ac voltage into dc voltage is called rectification.

A rectifier circuit uses diode for rectification. There are two types of rectification processes;
half wave rectification and full wave rectification.

_For the positive half cycle of the AC
voltage, the diode D is forward biased,
so it offers very low resistance and
current flows through the resister R.
Hence when the diode is forward

biased, it acts as a closed switch, as “Figure 20. 4: ettecti ircuit of half retinal
ure ive circuit of ha a.
shown below in the Fig. 20.4 (a). during: (a) forward biased (b) reversed biased.

For the negative half cycle of the AC
voltage, the diode D is reversed biased, so it offers very high resistance and no current flows ©
through the resister R (the output voltage is equal to zero). Hence when the diode is reversed
biased, it acts as an open switch, as shown in the Fig. 20.4 (b). The half-wave rectifier’s
waveform before and after rectification is shown in the Fig. 20.5. The output waveform of a
halfwave rectifier is a pulsating DC waveform. Filters in halfwave rectifiers are used to
transform the pulsating DC waveform into constant DC waveforms. A capacitor can be used as

a filter.

--- PAGE 111 ---
20.2.2 Full Wave Rectification

In full wave rectification, the complete cycle of AC signal is converted into pulsating DC. The
circuit of the full wave rectifier can be constructed in two ways. The one method uses a centre-
tapped transformer and two diodes. This arrangement is known as a centre-tapped full wave
rectifier. Another method uses four diodes arranged as a bridge. This is known as a bridge
rectifier. Here we will discuss only full wave bridge rectifier circuit.

Working of a Full Wave Bridge Rectifier: A full wave bridge rectifier is shown in the Fig.
20.6 (a). The circuit consists of four diodes D,, D2, D3; and D4 connected to form a bridge.

(a) Bridge rectifier (b) Positive half cycle _  (¢) Negative half cycle

Figure 20.6: (a) Full wave bridge rectifier circuit. (b) Working of a full wave rectifier circuit during
positive half cycle. (c) Working of a full wave rectifier circuit during negative half cycle. The arrows
are showing the direction of the current flow.

During positive half cycle of secondary voltage, the end A becomes positive and end B is
negative, as shown in Fig: 20.6 (b). This makes diodes D; and D2 forward biased and diodes D;
and D, reverse biased. Therefore, diodes D; and Dz conduct while diodes D; and D, do not

conduct. Thus, current (I) flows through diode D;, load resistor R (from top to bottom), diode
Dz and to the negative terminal of input.

During negative half cycle, the end A becomes negative with respect to end B, as shown in Fig.
20.6 (c). This brings diodes D3 and D, under forward bias and diodes Dy and Dz under reverse
bias. Therefore, diodes D3 and Ds conduct while diodes D; and Dz do not. Thus, current flows

through diode Ds, load resistor R (from Top to bottom), diode D, and to the negative terminal
of input, as shown in Fig. 20.6 (c).

It is obvious that one pair (D; and D2) allows current flow during the positive half cycle
of input voltage while the other pair (D3 and D,) allows current flow during the negative
half cycle of input voltage. The current flowing through the load resistor R is in the
same direction (top to bottom) during both half cycles. Hence, rectified output voltage

is obtained across the load resistor R. The wave shape of input and output voltage is
shown in Fig. 20.7.

Filtering

In a rectifier circuit (as shown in the Fig. 20.8-a), a capacitor smooths out the pulsating direct
current (DC) into a more stable, constant output. This process is often referred to as ‘filtering’.

As the voltage rises up to the peak of the input waveform, the capacitor charges to the peak
voltage. When the input voltage drops, the capacitor discharges slowly by supplying charge to
the load. The capacitor’s discharge helps to fill in the gaps between the peaks of the rectified
waveform, thereby reducing the voltage fluctuations and making the output smoother, as shown
in the Fig. 20.8 (b).

(a) (b)
Figure 20.8: (a) Full-wave rectifier with capacitor: (b) smoothing action by capacitor.

The choice of capacitance value and load resistance depends on the specific application
requirements. A higher capacitance value provides better smoothing, but may increase the
charging current. A lower load resistance causes the capacitor to discharge faster, reducing its

ability to smooth the output.
20.3. MUTUAL INDUCTANCE AND SELF-INDUCTANCE

Self-induction: Consider a coil, which is connected to a source of emf say a battery, through
a switch and a rheostat, as shown in Fig. 20.9 (a). If we move the rheostat quickly, the current
through the coil will change with time. This change in current in the coil, changes the magnetic
field, hence the flux through the coil changes, which finally induces an emf in the coil itself.

‘National Book Foundation (2) 20-Alternating Current.

--- PAGE 113 ---
The phenomenon, in which a changing current induces an emf in the coil itself, is called self-
induction. :

Self-induced emf in a coil is proportional to time
rate of change of current through the coil, i.e.,

Al

Self-inductance of the coil ‘L’ can be defined as:

Self-inductance of a coil is the ratio of emf
induced in the coil to the time rate of change of
current through it,

Eq. (i) can also be written as: , |

™% }

Figure 20.9 (a): Self-induction = <a

The negative sign in eq. (20.4) is with accord of Lenz’s law. It indicates that self-induced emf

opposes the change, which produces it. due to this reason, self-induced emf is sometimes called
as ‘Back emf’. Due to self-inductance of coils, these are also known as ‘Inductors’ or ‘choke’.

Inductors are widely used in electrical technologies. In A.C. circuits they behave like resistors.

From the eq. (20.4), the unit of self-inductance |

is henry (H),
H=VsA'

In case of self-inductance, one henry can be | 4H

defined as:

Self-inductance of a coil will be one henry, if one |
volt emf is induced in the coil by the change of |
current at the rate of one ampere per second.

Mutual Induction: Consider two neighboring “Figure 20.9 (b): Mutual induction between
coils, as shown in Fig. 20.9 (b). One coil is twocoils

connected to an emf-source (A.C supply or D.C

source with varying magnitude), while the other coil is connected to a galyanometer. The coils
are placed near each other, such that the flux of coil-1 links with the coil-2. When A.C flows
through coil-1 due to change of magnitude and direction of A.C, flux through the coil-1 changés,
as this flux also links the coil-2, the. changing flux through the coil-2 induces an emf in it, which
can be seen by deflection of galvanometer’s needle connected to the coil-2. This is called.
mutual induction, which can be defined as:

1

The phenomenon, in which changing current in one coil, induces an emf in neighboring coil, is
called mutual induction.

The emf induced in coil-2 is proportional to time rate of change of current through the coil-1,

The negative sign in the equation shows, that the direction of induced current is such that, it
opposes the change of current in the coil-1. From above relation the value of mutual inductance
‘M’ can also be written as: _

M=—2— :
Al, /At ii
The unit of mutual-inductance is also henry (H). In case of mutual inductance, one henry can
be defined as:

Mutual inductance between two coils is 1 henry if current changing at the rate of 1 A/s in one |
‘coil induces an emf of 1 V in the other coil.

20.4 — PHASE. OF A.C

In an AC circuit, the alternating current and voltage do not peak at the same time through
capacitors or Inductors. Sometime voltage may be passing through its zero point while the
current has passed or it is yet to pass through its zero point in the same direction. The angle
between their zero points is the phase difference. The quantity which passes through its zero
point earlier is said to leading while the other is said to be lagging. Since both alternating
quantities have the same frequency, the phase difference between them remains the same.

The fractionof a period difference between the peaks expressed in degrees is said to be the
phase. difference.

It is represented by ©. It is genibfalli measured in degrees or radians. The phase difference is
always less than or equal to 90° (It is customary to use the angle by which the voltage leads the
current).

20.4.1 A.C. Through Resistor

Consider a circuit containing a resistor connected across an alternating 1
voltage source as shown in Fig 20.10 (a).

The alternating voltage is be given by: ‘

V = Vo Sinwt (i) LY
Where, V. is the peak value of the alternating iieen As a result of
this voltage, an alternating current ‘I’ will flow in the circuit. According

20.4.2. A.C Through an Inductor

An inductor is an electrical component which opposes changes in 1
electric current passing through it. It consists of a conductor (such |
as a wire) usually wound into a coil. |

Consider an alternating voltage is applied acrossan inductor of |
inductance L, as shown in Fig. 20.11 (a). Let the equation for . V

alternating current is:
| = |, sinwt

When a sinusoidal current ‘I’ flows in time t then a back e.m.f,
(=LAI/At) is induced due to the inductance of the coil. This back Figure 20:44 (a): A.C ;

coil. As there is no drop in potential across the inductor (because _ —_
resistance of an ideal inductor is zero), so the applied voltage /ReCIaIiimiet rs

has to overcome the back emf, i.e.,
Applied alternating voltage = Back emf (ii)

So, the energy which is required in building up current in
inductance L, is returned back during the decay of the current.
The changing current sets up a back e.m.f in the coil. The A choke is an inductor used

magnitude of back e.m.f is: in a circuit. It offers high

From Eq. (i) and Eq. (20.6), it is clear that:
In an inductor, voltage leads the current by m/2 radians or 90°. 90°

Figure 20.11 (b) also shows that current lags the voltage in an inductive |
coil. Inductance opposes the change in current and serves as increase or

decrease of current in the circuit. This causes the current to lag behind _ Figure 20.11 (c):

Inductive Reactance (X:): The opposition offered by an inductor to the flow of A.C. is called
inductive reactance. Therefore, in analogy to Ohm’s law we can write:

Vo * lo Xt
or Xt = Vo

or X= = (using Vo = Io wl )

X = wl or X. = 2nf bl (20.7)
Hence, reactance of a coil depends upon frequency of A.C. In 1

case of D.C, f = 0 so X:=0. Inductance has the same dimensions
as resistance; therefore, it is measured in Q.

alternating voltage, the capacitor is charged in one direction

and then in the other as the voltage reverses. The result is

that electron move to-and-fro around the circuit, connecting Figure 20,12 (a): A.C through
the plates, thus constituting alternating current. The basic 4 capacitor.

20.5 IMPEDANCE

Impedance is the combine effect of the resistance and the reactance present in an AC circuit.
Thus, impedance can be broken down into resistance and reactance. Impedance is equivalent
to resistance in AC circuit. These two provide opposition to the flow of alternating current in
the circuit, and are generated due to the presence of capacitor and inductor. Let us explore
impedance in RL and RC series circuits:

RL Series AC Circuit

Consider an AC circuit in which a resistor (R) is R
connected in series with a coil of pure
inductance (L), as shown in Fig. 20.13 (a). Here,
the voltage ‘V’ will be the phasor sum of the
two component voltages, Ve and V.. This means
that the current flowing through the coil will
still lag the voltage, but by an amount less than
90° depending upon the values of Ve and Vi.
Taking current as the reference phasor, the

SUMMARY

* One complete set of positive and negative values of an alternating quantity is known as a
cycle.
* The time taken to complete one cycle of an alternating quantity is called its time period.

“~ The number of cycles that occurs in one second is called the frequency of the alternating
quantity. It is measured in cycle/second or Hertz.

“ The average value of a waveform is the average of all its values over a period of time.
Maximum value of alternating quantity (current or voltage) is called peak value.

¢ The r.m.s value of an alternating current is that steady current (d.c.) which when flowing
through a resistor produce the same amount of heat as that produced by the alternating
current when flowing through the same resistance for the same time.

* The process of converting ac voltage into dc voltage is called rectification.

* Ina half-wave rectification process an AC signal is converted into DC by passing one half-
cycle of the waveform and blocking the second-half.

* In full wave rectification, the complete cycle of AC signal is converted into pulsating DC.

National Book Foundation 20-Alternating Current

--- PAGE 121 ---
* Ina rectifier circuit, a capacitor smooths out the pulsating direct current (DC) into a more
stable, constant output. This process is often referred to as ‘filtering’.

“ The phenomenon, in which a changing current induces an emf in the coil itself, is called
self-inductance. Self-inductance of a coil is the ratio of emf induced in the coil to the time
rate of change of current through it.

Self-inductance of a coil will be one henry, if 1 volt emf is induced in the coil by the change
of current at the rate of one ampere per second.

*

« The phenomenon, in which changing current in one coil, induces emf in neighboring coil, is
called mutual induction.

Mutual inductance between two coils is 1 henry if current changing at the rate of 1 A/s in
one coil induces an emf of 1 V in the other coil.

“ The fraction of a period difference between the peaks expressed in degrees is said to be
the phase difference.

* In an inductor, volage leads the current by : radians or 90°.
* In acapacitor, volage lags the current by = radians or 90°.

“ A Choke is an inductor used in.a circuit. It offers high reactance to frequencies above a
certain frequency range, without appreciable limiting the flow of current.

“ Impedance is the combine effect.of the resistance and the reactance present in an AC
circuit.

Quantum theory is the foundation of Modern Physics. At the smallest scales, the classical laws
for real cases no longer apply, so quantum physics explains the nature and behaviour of matter
and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. Quantum physics is the branch of physics that
studies the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. In this realm, the
rules of classical physics are replaced by strange and counterintuitive phenomena. Quantum
physics is not just a curiosity, but has led to countless technological innovations, from
transistors and lasers to computer chips and medical imaging.

In this chapter, we'll study the fundamental principles and fascinating concepts of quantum
physics that help us in exploring our universe.

21.1 ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE

In 1864, the British physicist James Clerk Maxwell made the remarkable ideas that accelerated
electric charges generate linked electric and magnetic disturbances that can travel through
space, as shown in Fig. 21.1. These electric field (E) and magnetic field (B) can sustain each
other, forming an electromagnetic wave that propagates through space with speed about 310°
ms‘. The direction of propagation is the direction of the vector product E x B. Electric and

magnetic components of an electromagnetic wave are perpendicular to each other and to the
direction of motion.

Figure 21.1: A pair of electric (red) and magnetic (blue) fields, propagating together as an
electromagnetic wave in the direction indicated by the arrow at the speed of light.

Visible light emitted by the glowing filament of light bulb is an example of electromagnetic
wave. There are many other waves which are electromagnetic in nature, e.g. radio waves,
microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays, as shown in Fig. 21.2.

The visible wavelength spectrum of electromagnetic wave lies in between 750 nm (Red) and
390 nm (Violet). The electromagnetic wave travels through vacuum or through any specific
medium from one point to another point depending on energy.

Plank's Quantum Theory

Planck's quantum theory is the fundamental theory of quantum mechanics. In 1900, Plank
studied the electromagnetic radiation emitted from different atoms and molecules, and
proposed a theory which was in complete agreement with experiments at all wavelengths.
According to this theory:

1) Different atoms and molecules can emit or absorb energy (E) in discrete amount only, which

is given by:

E=nhf (21.1)
Here n-= 1, 2, 3, .... _is called quantum number, h = 6.626x10™ J s is the plank’s constant and
f is the frequency of the radiation.

The energies of the molecules are said to be quantized, and the allowed energy state are called
quantum states. Atoms or molecules emit or absorb energy only by jumping from one quantum
state to another.

2) The smallest amount of energy that can be emitted or absorbed in the form of
electromagnetic radiation is known as quantum (plural quanta).

The development of Plank's theory gave the birth to the Quantum Physics.

The setup to observe the photoelectric
effect is shown in Fig. 21.3. An evacuated
glass tube contains a metal plate connected
to the negative terminal of a battery.
Another metal plate is maintained at a
positive potential by the battery. When the
tube is kept in dark, the ammeter (A) shows
zero reading, indicating that there is no
current in the circuit. However, when light
of the appropriate frequency falls on the
metal surface, a current is detected by the
ammeter, indicating a flow of charges across
the gap between the metal surface and the
detector. The current associated with this

process arises from electrons emitted from the negative plate and collected at the positive
plate. Ultraviolet light is required in the case of emission of electrons from an alkali metal.

Effect of Applied Voltage on Photoelectric Current

A graph of the photoelectric current
versus the potential difference (V)
between the metal plate and the
detector for different light intensities is
shown in Fig. 21.4. It can be noted from
the graph that:

cause the individual electrons to gain higher energies. It means that the maximum K.E of the

electrons is independent of the intensity of
light has larger amplitude and thus delivers

the light. Classical physics says that more intense
more energy. That should not only enable a larger

number of electrons to escape from the metal; it should also enable the electrons emitted to

have more K.E.

e When V is negative (i.e. when the battery in the circuit is reversed) the photoelectrons are
repelled by the negative plate. Only those electrons having a K.E greater than ‘eV’ will
reach the detector, where ‘e’ is the charge on electron.

e If Vis greater than or equal to Vo, called

the stopping potential, no electrons will reach the

detector and the current will be zero. The stopping potential is independent of the radiation

through the relation.

K.Emax = @Vo (21.2)
Effect of Intensity of Incident Radiation on Photoelectric Current

If the frequency of the incident radiation and the potential
difference (V) between the cathode and the anode is kept
constant and the intensity of incident radiation is varied, ~
then it is found that the photoelectric current increases
linearly with the intensity of incident radiation, as shown in

Fig. 21.5. Since the photoelectric current is directly £

proportional to the number of photoelectrons emitted per
second, so it implies that: Intensity of light

proportional to the intensity of incident radiation. intensity of light.
Effect of Frequency of Incident Radiation on K.E of Photoelectrons

The maximum K.E of photoelectrons depends on the frequency of the incident radiation, as
shown in Fig. 21.6. If the incident light is very dim (low intensity) but high frequency, electrons
with large K.E are released. Classical physics K-Emax

gives no explanation for the frequency
dependence.

For a given metal, there is a threshold frequency
‘f.” below which no electrons are emitted, how
intense the incident light may be. Classical
physics has no explanation for the frequency
dependence.

Photon (Quantum) Theory of Photoelectric Effect

In the year 1905, Albert Einstein reinterpreted Planck’s theory to further explain the
photoelectric effect. Basically, Planck’s work led Einstein in determining that light exists in
discrete quanta of energy, called photons.

According to Einstein, the emission of photoelectron is the result of the interaction between a
single photon of the incident radiation and an electron in the metal. When the photon's energy
(E=hf) is transferred to an electron in a metal, a part of its energy (®) is used by the electron
to break away from the metal and the rest appears as the maximum K.E of the electron. i.e.,

National Book Foundation 21-Quantum Physics

a i — ~~ a
< }
J =e = * —_ =. ee

E = @® + K.Emax (21.3)
This is called Einstein's photoelectric equation. Here, O=hf, is the work function.

When K.E of the photoelectron is zero, the frequency ‘f’ is equal to threshold frequency fo,
hence the Einstein's photoelectric equation becomes:

hf. = ©
Hence, we can also write Einstein's photoelectric equation as:
K.Emax = E - hfo

e If E<@, there will be no photoelectric effect.

e If E = @, the photoelectric effect occurs, but the kinetic energy of the expelled
photoelectron is 0.

e If E > ®, the photoelectric effect will occur and the expelled electron possesses kinetic
energy.

There are so many practical utilizations of photoelectric effect; for example, photocells,
photoconductive devices, and solar cell, etc.

Example 21.2: A metal whose work function is 4.2 eV is irradiated by radiation whose
wavelength is 2000 A. Find the maximum kinetic energy of emitted electron.
Given: Work function = ® = 4.2 eV = 4.2x 1.6 x 10°" J = 6.72 x 107 J

yg A COMPTON'S EFFECT

Arthur H. Compton in 1923, conducted an experiment in which he made incident a beam of X-
rays of. wavelength A, on a block of graphite. He found that the scattered X-rays had a slightly
longer wavelength A‘ than the incident X-rays, as shown in Fig. 21.7. The amount of energy

reduction depended on the angle at which the X-rays were scattered. This phenomenon is
known as Compton’s effect.

National Book Foundation 429 21-Quantum Physics

--- PAGE 130 ---
Compton's effect is the phenomenon where X-rays rays scatter off electrons, transferring energy
and momentum, and increasing the wavelength of the scattered radiation.

The change in wavelength AA, between a scattered X-ray and an incident X-ray is called the
Compton shift.

In order to explain this effect, Compton
assumed that if a photon behaves like
* particle, its collision with other particles is
similar to that between two billiard balls.
Hence, both energy and momentum must
be conserved. If the incident photon

By applying conservation of energy, we

have Figure 21.7: Compton’s Effect.

hf = K.E + hf’ (21.4)
Here, “hf” and “hf’” represent the energy of the incident and scattered photon, respectively,
K.E is the kinetic energy given to the recoiling electron. By applying conservation of momentum,
we have:

P=P, +P (21.5)
Where p, and p’ represents the momentum of scattered photon and recoiling electron.

According to classical electromagnetic theory, EM waves carry momentum of magnitude E/c,
where E is the energy of waves and c is the speed of light. Thus, the momentum of a photon is
Take the incident photon’s direction along the x-axis, we can write the Eq. (21.6) in components
as:

Along x-axis : =p, cos® +2 cose (21.7)
Along y-axis 0=-p,sin® + sin8 (21.8)

The quantity ae 0.00243 nm is constant and is known as the Compton wavelength because

conversion of energy into mass. Three parameters
are conserved during the pair production; Charge, Momentum, and Energy.
Conservation of Charge: Charges must be conserved in this process. As electron and positron
having opposite charge means that the sum of net charge of pairs is zero, which is actually
equal to that of photon before the collision. Therefore, the conservation of electric charge will:
be observed in this process. It is impossible for a photon to produce a single electron, a single
positron, two electrons, or two positrons, because the photon has zero charge and then charge
will not be conserved.

nt

Conservation of Momentum: Momentum must also be conserved in this process. If — is the

momentum of photon, mv,, is the momentum of positron and mv, is shea NGsibentiain of

electron, then apply conservation of momentum, we have:

nf mv .+mv (21.11)
c = sd

Conservation of Energy: Energy must be conserved in the process of pair production to occur,
i.e.,

As the total energy of a particle with mass ‘m’ is the sum of its kinetic energy (K.E) and its rest
mass energy ( moc”), so Eq. (21.12) can be written as:

hf = (K.E etectron + moc? )+ (K.E positron * moc?)

(21.12 b)

National Book Foundation (a1) 21-Quantum Physics

--- PAGE 132 ---
Where, E = moc? = 0.511MeV. Thus, a photon must have energy of at least 2moc? in order to
create an electron-positron pair. If the photon energy is greater than 2m.c? (= 1.02 MeV) the
excess energy appears as K.E of the electron and positron.

21.5 PAIR ANNIHILATION

Pair annihilation is the reverse process of pair production. Pair production is the process in
which energy (photon) is converted into mass (electron-positron) and annihilation is the process
in which mass (electron-positron) is converted into

energy (photon)

Pair annihilation is a process in which an electron-

positron pair combines to produce two photons. positron @

Some other examples of pair annihilation are proton-antiproton annihilation and Higgs
production. Besides confirming the photon model of EM radiation, pair annihilation and pair
production clearly illustrate Einstein's idea about mass and rest energy.

21.6 THE WAVE-PARTICLE DUALITY

Interference, diffraction and polarization.are the basic properties of all electromagnetic waves.
As light shows all the three effects, therefore, light can be considered as a wave. But
Photoelectric effect can be explained only when we consider light as made by smatt energy
packets (particles) called photon. It means photoelectric effect shows the particle nature of
light. The light displays the dual nature, i.e., particle characteristics as well as wave
characteristics.

In 1924, the French physicist Louis De Broglie predicted that if light (which characteristically
demonstrated as pure wave properties) can have particle-like properties, then particle can also
behave as a wave. So, particles of matter obey a wave equation just as photon does. Compton's
investigation showed that the momentum p of a photon having wavelength A is described by
the equation;

or > (21.14)

Eq. (21.14) is called De Broglie relation and is a general formula that applies to material
particles as well as to photons. This relation shows that a wavelength is associated with a
moving particle, greater the particle's momentum the shorter its wavelength and vice versa.
For macroscopic objects of heavy masses, their corresponding wavelengths are very small to be
measured. For example, De Broglie wavelength of an object having mass 0.5 kg moving with a
speed of 10 ms" ts

This wavelength is comparable with the spacing between the atoms in a crystal, which fs

There are so many practical applications of De-Broglie equations, for example; the theory
behind the construction of electron microscope is the De-Broglie theory, which is commonly
used now a day to study the deep observation of microscopic organisms like viruses, bacteria

LECTRON MICROSCOPE

The electron microscope is a device that is based on the wave nature of electron. In microscope,
accelerated electrons are used as illumination source. This microscope helps us to observe
objects in detail even up to nano-scale with remarkably high resolution. Tungsten metal
(material) and high potential source are used for excitation of electrons to form an electrons
stream like a beam of light. Magnetic coils are used for focusing the electrons- beam on the

current is increased significantly and resultantly the strength of magnetic lens (magnetic coils)
is increased.

intermediate lens, projector lens, detector or screen and vacuum system. The electron gun and
condenser lens are typically located in the upper part of the microscope. The sample stage and
objective lens are situated in the middle section, the intermediate and projector lenses are
located in lower part of microscope.

The detector or screen is usually located at the very bottom. The image may take the form of
photograph, often referred to as an electron micrograph.

Any microscope is capable of detecting details that are comparable in size to the wavelength
of radiation used to illuminate the object. Electron can be accelerated to very high kinetic
energies, giving them a very short wavelength about 100 times shorter than those of the visible
light (used in optical microscopes). As a result, electron microscope is able to provide details
about 100 times smaller. The study of metals and crystals became easy with the introduction
of an electron microscope.

21.8 HEISENBERG'S UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE

On microscopic level, we cannot measure any property of a particle without interacting with it
in some way; this introduces unavoidable uncertainty into the result. One can never measure
all the properties exactly. According to Planck’s point of view; E = hc/A, means a photon with

National Book Foundation , 21-Quantum Physics

CSE) ae UAE

a short wavelength has a large energy. Formulated by the German physicist and Nobel laureate
Werner Heisenberg in 1927, the uncertainty principle states that we cannot find both the
position and speed of a particle, such as a photon or electron, with perfect accuracy. It is a
consequence of the dual nature of matter. According to Heisenberg uncertainty;

It is impossible to accurately find both, the position and momentum of an object
simultaneously.

According to this principle; The product of uncertainties in determining the position and
momentum of a particle at the same instant is approximately equal to fh (read as ‘h-cut’);

whereas fi = z =1.054x 10" Js.
‘4

If position of a particle has an uncertainty Ax and that of the corresponding momentum is Ap,
then uncertainties are found to be related in general by the inequality as:

Ax. Ap 2h

It is impossible to know both the position and momentum ently: i.e., if Ax = 0 and Ap = o. In
quantum mechanics a particle is described by a wave, the term position refers; point where
the wave is concentrated. The uncertainty in position means; the position is uncertain to the
degree that the wave is spread out. While the uncertainty in momentum means; the momentum
is uncertain to the degree that the wavelength is unclear. These uncertainties are inherent in
the physical world and have nothing to do with the skill of observer; due to the very small value
of angular Planck’s constant, these Uncertgpries are not observable in normal everyday
situations.

If we want accuracy in position, we must use photons of shorter wavelength because the best
resolution we can get is about the wavelength of the radiation used. Short wavelength radiation
implies high frequency, high energy photons. When these collide with the electrons, they
transfer more momentum to the target. If we use longer wavelength i.e., less energetic
photons, we compromise resolution and position.

\f the energy is in the form of electromagnetic waves, the limited time available restricts the
accuracy with which we can determine the frequency of the electromagnetic waves. Let’s .
consider that the minimum uncertainty in the number of waves under observation is equal to
number of them that we counted divided by the time interval, the uncertainty in the frequency
can be measured as;
Af mR i.e., AE = RAf.
At

Another kind of uncertainty principle concerns uncertainties in simultaneous measurements of
the energy of a quantum state and its lifetime, if AE is the uncertainty in determining the
energy of the system and At is the uncertainty in determining the time to which this
determination refers, then the uncertainty principle for energy and time can be expressed as;

AE. At2h

A system that remains in metastable state for a very long time can have a well-defined energy,
but if it remains in a state for only a short time the uncertainty in energy must be

National Book Foundation (3s) 21-Quantum Physics

--- PAGE 136 ---
> |

correspondingly greater. The uncertainty AE depends on the time interval At during which the
system remains in the given state.

Example 21.5: Calculate the uncertainty in the momentum of an electron if uncertainty in
its position is 1 A ( 10°? m).

Given: Ax = 10° m

21.9 DISCRETE ENERGY LEVELS IN AN ATOM AND ITS SPECTRA

The electrons orbiting an atom can only occupy certain allowed orbits (also called shells). Each
orbit has a discrete energy state of the atom e.g. E:, Ez, Es and so on, as shown in the Fig.
21.11. Electrons can move from one allowed energy level to another only by gain or loss of
certain amount of energy.

e Energy is required for
an electron to move
from a lower to a
higher energy level.
This transition is
called an excitation.

e Energy is released if
the electron moves
from a higher to a
lower energy level.
This transition is

--- PAGE 137 ---
Where E, and E, are higher and lower energy states respectively.

Photons emitted from such transitions, when allowed to pass through a narrow slit and a prism
(or diffraction grating), will give rise to a set of line spectrum, unique to the element, as shown
in Fig. 21.12. A spectrum is produced by using a prism or diffraction grating to separate the

various wavelengths in a beam of light. A line spectrum contains a discrete set of wavelengths.
It is a characteristic feature of an element.

Figure 21.12: Setup for obtaining spectrum.

An emission spectrum of an element consists of a series of separate bright lines of definite
frequencies (or wavelengths) on a dark background. It is produced when a stream of photons of
different frequencies is passed through a narrow slit and normally through a diffraction grating.
These photons are emitted randomly from transitions (from higher to lower excited states or
the ground state) in the excited atoms of the element in a vapour or gas at low pressure.
Emission spectra of Hydrogen is shown in Fig. 21.13 (a). Since each element has a unique set of
orbital electrons, the emission line spectrum of an element is also unique, enabling it to be
_ used as a means of identification of the element.

An absorption line spectrum of an element consists of a series of separate dark lines of definite
frequencies (or wavelengths) on a coloured background. The coloured background is produced
when a stream of photons of different frequencies from a white’ light source (e.g. tungsten
filament lamp) is passed through a narrow slit and a diffraction grating. The cool vapour of the
element concerned is placed between the white light source and the narrow slit, such that its
atoms may absorb excitation energy from photons incident from the white light source. The
unabsorbed photons frem-the white light source will be incident onthe screen with the original

intensity. After the absorption, the excited atoms will eventually go back to the ground state
by emitting the same photons absorbed earlier. Absorption spectra of Hydrogen are shown in
Fig. 21.13 (b).

SUMMARY

“@ When electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by a material, electronically-charged particles
are released from the material (or even within itself). This phenomenon is called the
photoelectric effect.

* Conservation of momentum implies that if two or more bodies interact with each other in
an isolated system™(that»is, no external force is acting up6n them), then the total
momentum of all the bodies remains constant.

The electrons which are emitted from a metal surface upon the influence of light are called
photoelectrons.

Threshold energy is the minimum amount of energy needed by the electron to break free
from the metal and eject from it.

Threshold frequency is the lowest frequency of electromagnetic radiation that will produce

_ a photoelectric effect in a material.

The threshold wavelength is the largest possible wavelength of the incident radiation which
allows photoemission to take place. No photoemission occurs if the wavelength is higher
than the threshold.

Nuclear physics is a branch of physics that deals with the study of the atomic nucleus, its
properties and interactions. We studied in grade-10, that the atomic nucleus is composed of
protons and neutrons, which are collectively referred as nucleons. The atomic number ‘Z’ of
an element corresponds to the number of protons in the nucleus, while the mass number ‘A’ is
the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Number of neutrons in an atom
' 4s represented by ‘N’ and is called neutron number. The relation between atomic number, mass
number and neutron number can be given by the following equation: A = Z + N.

Nuclear physics has numerous applicatiofis, including nuclear power generation, nuclear
medicine, and nuclear weapons. It also plays a crucial role in the study of astrophysics, as
nuclear reactions are responsible for the energy production in stars and other celestial bodies.

22.1 MASS DEFECT

If we have a polythene bag of negligible mass containing 10 5
balls, each ball having a mass of 100 grams, then what To

the masses of atoms

should be the mass of the whole basket? Definitely it would
be 1000 grams (1 kg) as it is our common observation that
the mass of whole is the sum of masses of the constituents.
But the same is not true for the nucleus. The total mass of
nucleus is less than the sum of masses of its individual
nucleons. For example, the mass of carbon should be
greater than 12 u, as its constituent protons and neutrons
have masses greater than 1 u bit it has a mass of exactly
12 u which is less than the sum of masses of six protons and
six neutrons. Similarly, mass defect for binding of one
proton and one neutron in case of deuterium (*H) can be
shown in Fig. 22.1. Let ‘Mnucieus’ be the mass of nucleus,
‘m,’ is the mass of proton and ‘m,’ is the mass Of neutron
then during the formation of the nucleus ‘Am’ is the
difference in mass which is known as the mass defect.
Mathematically the mass defect can be given as:

Am = (Mn + Mp) — Moucteus

express

and nuclei in nuclear physics we
use ‘atomic mass unit” (amu). It is
defined as one twelfth of the mass
of a carbon-12 atom. It can be

The mass of deuterium is less than the sum of the masses of one proton and one neutron. This
difference in mass of a nucleus is called as mass defect, and can be defined as:

The difference between the mass of the nucleus and sum of the masses of its constituent
particles is called as mass defect.

In general, the equation for the mass defect can be given as:

R Am = [(A — Z) ma + Z Mp] — Moucieus (22.1)

Example 22.1. Find the mass defect in the formation of Helium-4 nucleus. If the mass of
He-4 is 4.002603u, the mass of proton is 1.007276u and the mass of neutron is 1.008665u.
Given: Mass of He-4: = m,,. = 4.002603u Mass of proton = m, = 1.007276u

As we know that for helium-4 nucleus there are two protons.and two neutrons hence Z=2 and
(A—Z)= 4 — 2 = 2 now putting valeues, we get:
Am =[(4—2) (1.008665) + 2 (1.007276) — 4.002603] u = 0.029279 u

Assignment 22.1
Find the mass defect of tritium nucleus. The mass of tritium is 5.0083x10” kg.

22.2 BINDING ENERGY

The mass defect. remained a mystery for some time. But soon the scientists found that in
formation of the nucleus, the missing mass is converted into energy. As during the formation of
nucleus, energy is found to be released and conversely to break the nucleus into its parts. An
equal amount of energy is to be given for this break. The mass converted into the energy is

called as binding energy and can be defined as:
The minimum energy required to break an isolated nuclei into its constituent particles is called
the binding energy.
The Einstein’s famous equation relates this energy and mass which can be given as:

E = Amc? (22.2)
Here ‘E’ is the energy required to break the nucleus or the energy released during formation of
the nucleus, ‘Am’ is the mass defect and ‘c’ isthe speed of light whose approximate value is
3x10°ms-~'. This relation proves that the mass can be converted into energy and energy can

be converted back into the mass i.e. mass and
energy are inter-convertible quantities. The

relation between binding energy and the mass can CY) ALY (3)
be shown in Fig. 22.2 (a). It is to note that the + oe —— (=)
units for mass used in above equation should be in nudeons
kilograms. For example, helium-4 nucleus Figure 22.2 (a): Binding energy.

containing two protons and two neutrons has a
combined mass of 4.002603 amu while the sum of masses of two protons and two neutrons is

4.031882 amu. The mass defect can be given as:
Am = (4.031882 — 4.002603) amu= 0.029279 amu

The equivalence of this mass in kg can be given as:

This is the amount of energy required to break the Helium-4 nucleus. This is relatively a small

Binding Energy per Nucleon

The binding energy of an atomic nucleus is the amount of energy required to completely
separate all of its constituent nucleons (protons and neutrons). It is a measure of the strength
of the nuclear force that holds the nucleus together. The binding energy is usually expressed in
electron-volts or in joules. As from equation (22.2):
E=Amc’. -

Using the values of mass defect ‘Am’ from
equation (22.1) we get:

=((A-Z) m+Z™m, —Myses) ©
Here ‘E’ is the binding energy. The absolute
value of binding energy does not explain
completely the stability of a nucleus. The
more important. thing to explain the
stability of a nucleus is the binding energy
per nucleon i.e. how much mass is
converted by each nucleon to form a nucleus. The greater the binding energy per nucleon the |
greater will be the stability of the nucleus. The binding energy per nucleon also called as
packing fraction (f) and can be given as:

—_(@- nt Aa Mates ) ¢ ___(22.3)

Table 22.2: Binding energy

f=

The packing fraction also called the Reding fraction is the measure of stability of a nucleus.
Therefore, the rest energy of the bound system i.e. the nucleus is less than the combined rest
energy of the separated nucleons. The binding energies of some commonly used nuclei are given
in the table 22.2.

Example 22.3. Find packing fraction for C-12 nucleus. If mass of C-12 is 12.000u, mass of
proton is 1.007276 u and mass of neutron is 1.008665 u.

Given: Mass of carbon-12 = Mnucieus = 12.0 Number of protons = Z = 6
Mass of proton = m,=1.007276u = Number of neutrons = A-Z = N = 6
Mass of neutron =m, = 1.008665u

To Find: Packing fraction = f =?
Solution: We have to find the binding energy as: Am =(A—Z) m, +Z M,—Maxteus

Am = (6x 1.008665 + 6x 1.007276 — 12.000) = 0.095646 u

To convert it into MeV we take:

Binding Energy Curve &

The variation of binding energy per nucleon with mass number can graphically be represented
by a curve known as the binding energy curve. This curve shows the relationship between the
number of nucleons in a nucleus (represented by the mass number A) and the binding energy
per nucleon. The graph for binding energy per nucleon (in MeV) plotted against the mass number
(A) as we can see from Fig. 22.2 (b), the binding energy per nucleon increases as we move from
-the lightest nuclei (A = 1) towards the region of medium-sized nuclei (A = 50-100), reaching a
peak at around A = 56.

Figure 22.2 (b): Binding energy verses nucleon number

This region of medium-sized nuclei is known as the most stable nuclei or the valley of stability.
Beyond the region of medium-sized nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon starts to decrease
again, indicating that larger nuclei are less stable than smaller ones. This is because larger
nuclei have a higher proportion of repulsive electrostatic forces between protons, which are
not balanced by the attractive strong nuclear forces. The variation of binding energy per
nucleon with mass number is an important factor in nuclear physics, as it helps to explain the
stability and properties of atomic nuclei, and provides insight into nuclear reactions and nuclear
energy production. Nuclei with a higher binding energy per nucleon are generally more stable
and less likely to undergo fission. On the other hand, nuclei with a lower binding energy per
nucleon, such as uranium-235, are more likely to undergo fission when they absorb a neutron,
releasing energy and more neutrons, which can in turn cause further fission reactions. Fusion
reactions tend to produce more stable nuclei with a higher binding energy per nucleon than the

reactant nuclei. The fusion reactions release energy, as the product nucleus has a greater
binding energy per nucleon than the reactant nuclei. For example, the fusion of hydrogen nuclei
into helium releases a large amount of energy, as the product nucleus has a higher binding
energy per nucleon than the reactant nuclei.

22.3 RADIOACTIVITY

Marie Curie studied radioactivity (nuclear radiations emission) shortly after Henri Becquerel
discovered natural radioactivity. Marie Curie detected radioactivity in Uranium and Thorium
using an electrometer, which showed that the air around radioactive samples became charged
and conductive.

The natural emission of radiations from unstable nuclei is called radioactivity.
Radioactivity is the phenomenon by which unstable atomic nuclei spontaneously decay into
other nuclei, emitting radiation in the process. Spontaneous nuclear decay is the natural
process by which an unstable atomic nucleus breaks down into a more stable configuration by
emitting radiation. This process is spontaneous and occurs without any external influence or
trigger. Radioactive decay can also result in the formation of a new element known as the
daughter nuclei. Spontaneous nuclear decay is a natural process that occurs in many elements
in the universe. While it can poseva significant health hazards if not properly managed, it also
has many practical applications in fields such as energy production, medicine and materials
sciences. There are three main types of radioactive decay alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma
decay, along with these radiations some more radiations and particles are also produced like
X-rays and neutrons etc.

’ Alpha decay occurs when an atomic nucleus emits an alpha
particle, which is a helium nucleus consisting of two

protons and two neutrons. This reduces the atomic number Parent ™a Daughter

Here 7X is the parent nucleus which decays into 43Y
known as daughter nucleus with emission of alpha-particle }He which is helium-4 nucleus and

represented as:

™U > 7ETh + {He+Q
Here the uranium-238 nucleus (with 92 protons and 146 neutrons) decays into thorium-234 (with
90 protons and 144 neutrons) by emitting an alpha particle (with 2 protons and 2 neutrons).

22.3.2 Beta Decay

Beta decay occurs when an atomic nucleus emits a beta particle, which is an electron or a
positron.

National Book Foundation 22-Nuclear Physics

--- PAGE 148 ---
Beta decay can either increase or decrease the
atomic number of the nucleus, but always
conserves the total number of nucleons. Beta
decays are of two types i.e. the negative beta
decay and the positive beta decay.

i) Negative beta or beta-minus decay is the emission of an electron during nuclear activity. In
an unstable nucleus, when a neutron decays into proton it emits an electron and an anti-
neutrino. The equation for neutron decay can be given as:

angular momentum must be obeyed during the transition.

Even though no particles with mass are emitted during gamma decay, the emission of gamma
radiation can result in the change in energy of the nucleus. For example, if a nucleus a gamma
ray after undergoing alpha or beta decay it may end up in a different energy state. In such
cases the nucleus may still be unstable and may continue to undergo further radioactive decay
until it reaches a stable state. These laws imply that :

even though no particles with mass are emitted, the
composition of the nucleus is certainly changed after

22.3.4 Spontaneous and Random Nature of Nuclear Decay

Radioactive decay is a random process i.e.; it is impossible to predict exactly when a particular
unstable nucleus will decay. It may decay just on the moment you started observing it or it may
not decay even for years. The decay is a natural process inherent to the unstable nucleus itself.
It happens because the nucleus is seeking a more stable state. This randomness is reflected in

the fluctuations observed in the count rate of radioactive emission. Count rate can be defined
as:

National Book Foundation = (us) 22 Nuclear Physics

--- PAGE 150 ---
~ in a) Ree WM “d ia.. deacattio

The number of decays detected per unit time is called as count rate.

’ When measuring the count rate using a Geiger-Muller counter or any other counters it can be
noted that the count rate varies over time even if the conditions remain constant. These
fluctuations occur because each decay event is spontaneous, independent, random and
unpredictable.

Each radioactive nucleus has a certain probability of decaying at any given moment but we
cannot predict the exact time of decaying for any single nuclei, this property is known as
“spontaneity”. Although the individual decay events are random the average behavior of a large
number of nuclei follows a predictable pattern described by the half-life of the substance. This
is the reason that the count rate over longer periods becomes more stable and predictable in
spite of showing fluctuations over short interval decays. These evidences provide clear evidence
that decay events are not influenced by external factors and occur spontaneously. Spontaneous
nuclear decay is a natural process that occurs in many elements in the universe. While it can
pose a significant health hazard if not properly managed, it also has numerous practical
applications in fields such as energy production, medicine, and materials science.

Example 22.4. Calculate the amount of energy ‘Q’ released during the following nuclear
reaction. If mass of U-238 is 238,02891 u, mass of Th-234 is 234.04360 u and mass of alpha

particle is 4.001506u, 3U— Th + jHe+Q

Given: Mass of uranium-238 = M,, = 238.02891 u Mass of Thorium-234 = M, = 234.04360 u
Mass of alpha particle =, = 4.001506 u

To Find: Energy released = O=?

Solution: Energy in this nuclear reaction can be calculated as:
The total mass on L.H.S is: M, = 238.02891 u

The total mass on R.H.S is: M,+M, = 234.04360 u+ 4.001506 u = 238.045106 u
Since the difference in mass is converted into energy ‘Q’ then we can write as:
Q=M,—(M, +M,) = 238.02891 u—238.045106 U = -0.016196 u

The negative sign shows that the energy is absorbed during the nuclear decay i.e. it is
endothermic reaction. Now the amount of energy in MeV can be found as:
Q =-0.016196 ux931.5 MeV /u =15.0866 MeV

Hence 15.0866 MeV energy will be released when uranium-238 nuclei decays into thorium-234
while emitting an alpha particle.

22.4 HALF LIFE AND RATE OF DECAY

The half-life (T,,) of a radioactive material is a characteristic property of that material and is
defined as:

National Book Foundation 650) 22-Nuclear Physics

--- PAGE 151 ---
The time it takes for half of the radioactive nuclei to decay in a given sample is called as half-
life of that element.

For example, if we have 100 nuclei at
time ‘t = 0’ and after half-life the half of
the nuclei will disintegrate and half
would remain intact i.e., 50 nuclei of
parent element will remain. After second
half-life out of these 50 nuclei 25 will
disintegrate and 25 nuclei of parent
element will remain similarly after third
and fourth half-lives the remaining nuclei
of parent element will be 12.5 and 6.25
respectively. For example, the half-life
of cobalt-60 is 5.27 years and its decay :
with half-lives is shown in Fig. 22.8.

Although after every half-life the nuclei Oo re

become half of their initial value but still Figure 22.8: Decay of Co-60.

it takes infinite time for the

disintegration of all nuclei. The rate of disintegration of nuclei follows a law known as rate law
which can be defined as:

Table 22.3: Half-lives of same elements

The rate at which a radioactive substance decays
is directly proportional to the number of
radioactive nuclei present at any given time, is
called the rate law for nuclear decay.

While the ratio ‘ oo is called the activity in the radioactive decay process which is the

number of disintegrations per unit time. It is represented by ‘A’ and can be given as:

The SI unit of activity is becquerel (Bq) which can be defined as:
When a nucleus disintegrates at the rate of one disintegration per second then the activity is
equal to one becquerel. _

In nature, there are some Seasions present everywhere (called background radiation). rai:
we are constantly exposed to radiation in daily life, but the natural levels are typically low and
safe for humans and other biological objects on Earth. Harmful effects require higher radiation
doses. For example, the activity of radium used in the dial of a watch (to make it glow in the

dark) is 4x 10* Bq and for radiotherapy the dose range is 4x10" Bq.
A more common unit of activity is the curie which can be defined as:

When there is an activity at the rate of 3.70x10"° decays per second then the activity is equal
to one curie.

The inter conversion of these two units of activity can 7 given as:

From the above equation, it is clear that the beowerel is very Dealt unit as conipated to the

22.4.1 Exponential Nature of Nuclear Decay

Radioactive decay is exponential in nature. This means that the rate at which a radioactive
substance decays is proportional to the number of un-decayed nuclei present at any given time.

22.4.2 Relation between Decay Constant and Half-Life

The relation between decay constant and half-life can be deduced by considering a radioactive
element that has ‘ NV,’ number of nuclei at a certain instant. If the half-life of the element is

four hours, then after four hours the number of radioactive element’s nuclei left will be ‘N,/2’.
After eight hours i.e. after two half-lives the number of nuclei of the original element left will
be ‘N./4’’ similarly after twelve hours i.e. after three half-lives the number of nuclei of the
original element left will be ‘N./8’’ and so on. To represent the variation of un-decayed nuclei
as a function of time a graphical method is more suitable, as shown in Fig. 22.9.

Now the relation of half-life of a radioactive element can be given as:

Ty = _— or Ti = a

This equation shows the relationship between the decay constant and the half-life of an
element. The half-life of a radioactive material is determined by measuring the activity of a
given sample over a period of time. It is important to note that half-life is a characteristics
property of each radioactive element and it is used to describe the rate at which a radioactive
substance decays. The half-life of radioactive element is the duration it takes for half of the
original amount of the substance to decay into a more stable form. The longer the half-life of
a substance the slower is its rate of decay and less radiations it emits over time.

Example 22.6. Cesium-137 (a beta emitter used for treating cancer and in industrial devices
to measure the thickness of materials) has a half-life of 9.5x10° s. we have one mole of
cesium at the start. What will be the decay constant and activity for this decay?

22.5 NUCLEAR REACTIONS

Nuclear reactions are processes in which one or more nuclides are produced from collision
between two nuclei or one nucleus and a sub-atomic particle. A nuclear reaction is said to occur
when an incident nucleus, particle or photon causes a change in the target nucleus.

Nuclear reactions are processes in which atomic nuclei interact, resulting in changes to the
nucleus, such as fusion, fission, or radioactive decay, often releasing or absorbing energy.

A nuclear reaction changes the identity or characteristics of an atomic
nucleus by bombarding it with an energetic particle. The bombarding
particle may be an alpha particle, a gamma ray photon, a neutron, a proton
or a heavy ion. These bombarding particles must have enough energy to
approach the positively charged nucleus within the range of the strong
nuclear force. Let the nucleus ‘X’ is bombarded by some light particle ‘a’
which products a nucleus ‘Y’ along with a light particle ‘b’ mathematically:

a+X—>Y+b

The first ever nuclear transmutation, as shown in Fig. 22.10, observed by
Rutherford, is given below:

sSHe + "N > "0 + IH +Q

‘'H

Figure 22.10:
Nuclear reaction.

Where Q is the energy released or absorbed equivalent to the difference of the rest masses of
the elements on both sides of nuclear reaction. If ‘Q’ is positive the energy will be liberated in
the reaction called exothermic reaction and if ‘Q’ is negative the energy is absorbed in the
reaction called endothermic reaction. If thermal neutron (neutrons with energy equal to
surrounding atoms i.e. about 0.025 eV) is bombarded on nitrogen-14 nucleus, the following
reaction can be produced with release of a large amount of energy:

n+ “SN > “C+ 1H+Q

The product in this case is the radio carbon-14, a proton and heat energy. Similarly, deuteron
which has a unit positive charge and must have high energy to cause an induced nuclear reaction
as:

7H + SMn > Fe + jn +Q

All the conservation laws must be followed in a nuclear reaction including law of conservation
of mass-energy, momentum and charge etc. The main types of nuclear reactions due to low
value of binding energy per nucleons are nuclear fusion and nuclear fission which are explained
below.

Do you ever think the energy from the stars coming to us is obtained by which process? What is
the fuel of the Sun and how it produces tremendous amount of energy? Answer to these
questions lies in a simple nuclear reaction called the nuclear fusion reaction which can be
stated as:

A process where two or more light atomic nuclei come close to each other to form a heavier
nucleus by releasing a large amount of energy is called nuclear fusion.

Small nuclei combine to form heavier nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of
heat. This process occurs naturally in stars where the —_ peyterium Helium 4hHe
high temperature and pressure causes the nuclei to A
collide and fuse. The Sun’s core is the site of several &
nuclear reactions that powers its energy output.
Scientists are currently working on developing
nuclear fusion as a potential clean and sustainable
source of energy. A simple fusion reaction is shown
in Fig. 22.11 and can be written as:

Why small nuclei tend to fuse with each other? This is due to their low binding energy per
nucleon which makes them less stable as compared to the elements of region of greater

stability. They tend to fuse with each other to get themselves more stable. As from Fig. 22.12
the binding energy per nucleon increases when the mass number increases and becomes

--- PAGE 157 ---
maximum for ‘>Fe’ whose atomic mass is A = 56 which is 8.8 MeV per nucleon. The initial
increase in binding energy per nucleon favors the fusion reaction.

Energy in Nuclear Fusion: We can calculate the amount of energy released during nuclear
fusion reaction by using the concept of binding energy per nucleon as the total energy of fusing
nuclei in equation (22.1) can be given:

Mass of Deutrium = 2.014102 u Mass of Tritium = 3.016049 u
Total Mass = 5.030151 u

To covert this mass in kilograms, we proceed as:
Total. Mass = 5.030151 ux1.660x10’kg/u = 8.350x10kg

Energy of L.H.S of equation (22.1) is:

E = Amc? =8.350x10™ kgx(3x10°ms")? =7.515x10°J = 4696.87 MeV (i)

Now the total energy of product nuclei and particle in equation (22.1) can be given:
Mass of Helium = 4.002603 u Mass of Neutron = 1.008665 u

Total Mass = 5.011268 u

To covert this mass in kilograms we get:
Total Mass = 5.011268 ux1.660x10kg/u= 8.319x10kg

Energy of L.H.S of equation (22.1) is: .
E = Amc =8.319x10~ kgx(3x10°ms")? = 7.4871x10°° = 4679.438 MeV (ii)

Using these values in the equation (22.1), we get the amount of energy obtained/released in
the above fusion reaction as:

4696.87 MeV = 4679.438 MeV+ Q

or 4696.87 MeV — 4679.438 MeV = Q
or Q=17.43 MeV

Here positive value of Q shows that it is an exothermic reaction and heat is released in this
reaction. Hence a single event of fusion of deuterium and tritium forming helium and a neutron,
releases 17.43 MeV energy.

22.5.3 Nuclear Fission

Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann while working upon the nuclear reaction find a startling
discovery. They discovered a phenomenon called nuclear fission reaction which can be stated
as:

--- PAGE 158 ---
A process where the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei, with release of
large amount of energy is called nuclear fission.

The process is typically
initiated by bombarding
the nucleus with a
neutron, which causes it
to become unstable and
split apart. There are
different possible nuclear
reactions with different
daughter nuclei.they may
be different nuclei or
different isotopes of same
nuclei. For example; a Figure 22.13: Fission reaction.

nuclear reaction is shown in Fig. 22.13 and can be given as:

in + 3U > 2 — ‘Ba + 2Kr + 3jn +Q

(i)
In this reaction, when a slow neutron hits uranium-235, it forms an unstable nucleus (i.e.,
uranium-236 735U") that breaks into barium, krypton, neutrons, and releases a lot of energy.

Fission does not give the same product every time. Fission of uranium-235 can also yield
different elements, such as shown in the following equation:

! 235 236 132 tol |
on + GU > GU > ‘GSn + Mo + 3,n +Q

-The number of neutrons emitted during fission
reaction is not necessarily to be three, There are ‘—> "es
some reactions which emit two neutrons per fission
event. The product may be different isotopes of the

same elements as in equation (i), which is shown in
Fig. 22.14 and can be given as:

@ :K:

‘ ass ai = ‘ ‘ Figure 22.14; Fission reaction with
on + GU > %,U > YBa + Kr + 29n +Q different isotopes.

Nuclear fission has practical applications in nuclear power plants to generate electricity as well
as in nuclear weapons. As from Fig. 22.12, we can see that the binding energy per nucleon is
small for heavier nuclei and hence they are unstable and tend to get more stable condition.
The fission reaction occurs due to instability of heavy nuclei such that they may get small
fragments having larger stability.

Fission Chain Reaction: A single fission reaction may release two or three neutrons which can
further cause fission reactions. That further reactions produce more neutrons that cause more
fission reaction and so on.

A fission reaction in which every time at least one released neutron produces further fission
reaction then such succession of fission reactions is called fission chain reaction.

National Book Foundation 22-Nuclear Physics —

--- PAGE 159 ---
The neutrons produced during fission reaction are fast neutrons and can escape out of the
material without producing more fission reactions, as for fission, slow neutrons are required.
To sustain the fission process, we need one neutron per fission to be capable of carrying out
next fission. If the size of material is large, some of these neutrons may be captured to produce
further fission. Hence, we need a minimum mass of material to sustain fission chain reaction
which is called as critical mass and can be defined as:

The minimum mass of the material to sustain the fission chain reaction is known as the critical
mass.

If the mass of the material is less than the critical mass the fission process would soon come to
an end. But if the mass of the material is greater than the critical mass the fission process will
get uncontrolled and would léad to cause the nuclear bomb. If the mass of the sample is equal
to the critical mass (or the conditions are suitable for producing one more fission reaction per
event) controlled nuclear energy will be produced as in case of nuclear reactors. This process
is used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. In a nuclear weapon, the nuclear fission is
uncontrolled leading to a rapid and explosive release of energy. The potential for uncontrolled
chain reactions is what makes nuclear weapons so dangerous and that’s why strict safety
protocols are to be followed Lighter el t

to prevent any incident. Ina

shown in Fig. 22.15. The ee

critical mass of a material is

known as critical volume. Figure 22.15: Fission chain reaction.

Energy in Fission Reaction: A huge amount of energy is released in nuclear reactions,
particularly in nuclear fission reaction, which is much greater than the amount of energy
released in a typical chemical reaction. For example, a single fission event like the splitting of
uranium-235 nucleus releases about 200 MeV of energy. On the other hand, a chemical reaction
like combustion of fossil fuels release energy on the order of a few electron volts (eV) per
reaction. For example, energy released by one molecule of methane (CH,) gas is about 9.2 eV.

The fission of 1 kg of uranium-235 can produce about 2.5 million times more energy than burning
of 1 kg of coal. Hence, nuclear fission reaction releases energy that is millions of times greater
than that of chemical reactions. Due to this huge energy difference nuclear power plants are
so useful as compared to traditional chemical based energy sources.

Example 22.7. Find the amount of energy released by the following fission reaction if the
masses of uranium, barium and krypton are 235.12142 u, 140.883 u and 91.9262 u,

Given: Mass of uranium-235: 235.12142 u Mass of barium-141: 140.883 u
Mass of crypton-92: 91.9262 u Mass of neutron: 1.008665 u

To Find: Energy: Q =?

Solution: Total mass on L.H.S = 1.008665 u + 235.12142 u = 236.1301 u

So, Total energy on L.H.S = 236.1301 ux931.5 MeV/uc? = 219955.188 MeV/c?
Now Total mass on R.H.S = 140.883 u+ 91.9262 u+ (3x 1.008665) uU = 235.8352 u
So, Total energy on R.H.S = 235.8352 ux931.5 MeV/u c* = 219680.489 MeV/c?

Now to find the energy ‘Q’ for the above fission, put values in reaction equation:
219955.188 MeV/c? = 219680.489 MeV/c? + Q

or Q =219955.188 MeV/c? — 219680.489 MeV/c?

Q = 274.699 MeV/c?
Positive sign shows that the energy is released during the fission reaction.

22.6 NUCLEAR REACTORS

Large amount of energy is released in a nuclear fission reaction; therefore, it is carried under
controlled conditions. Then this energy is used for useful purposes like in the production of
electricity and radioisotopes.

Nuclear reactor is a device used to initiate and control a nuclear fission chain reaction.

A nuclear reactor typically consists of the core, fuel rods, control rods or safety rods,
moderator, coolant (heat exchanger) and shielding unit. A nuclear reactor is shown in Fig.
22.16.

Core of Reactor: The core is the main component of a nuclear reactor which contains the fuel
in which the nuclear fission process takes place. The core is the heart of a reactor where the
critical processes of nuclear fission and heat generation occur which enables the reactor to
function as a source of energy. It is designed to sustain a controlled nuclear fission chain
reaction. The main parts in the core of the nuclear reactor are:

Fuel Rods: The fuel used in nuclear reactor is typically Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, which
is in the form of small pallets and arranged into long rods of roughly 1 cm in diameter. Most
reactors use uranium in which the amount of Uranium-235 is enriched to about 3%. These rods

are placed into the reactor’s core.

--- PAGE 161 ---
shielding

Figure 22.16: Schematic diagram of Nuclear Reactor.

Control Rods: Control rods also called as safety rods play very important role in the action of
nuclear reactor as they are used to control the extent of reaction and do not allow the fuel to
react at once. They are made of a material such as boron or cadmium that absorbs neutrons.
These rods cofttrol the fission reaction by absorbing some of the neutrons and preventing them
from causing additional fission reactions as for the output of a reactor to be constant only one
neutron from each event should process further fission reaction. These rods can move into or
out of the reactor’s core as per need.

Moderator: Material that slows down the neutrons is called
moderator. Neutrons with energies of about 0.025 eV are used in
fission of uranium while the neutrons emitting from fission reaction
are fast and have energies in the range of MeV which is not required
for fission. The commonly used materials used as moderator are
water and graphite that slows down the neutrons produced by fission
as slowing down the neutrons make them more likely to cause
additional fission.

Figure 22.17:

Coolant: The coolant or heat exchanger is a fluid such as water or Moderator.

helium that circulates through the reactor’s core and carries away the heat produced by the
fission process. This heat is used to produce steam which in turns derives the turbines to
generate electricity. It also serves the purpose to cool the fuel rods and moderators from excess
heat. In the absence of a coolant the core can melt under the enormous heat produced by the
fission process. After passing through the generator the coolant passes through the condenser
which cooled down the material before entering again into the reactor’s core.

Shielding Unit: The by-product of a fission reaction includes strong radiations and energetic
particles which are harmful to human and the atmosphere. To keep human being safe, we have
to shield those radiations and high energy particles within the reactor such that they would not
release into the atmosphere. For the above said purpose we use a thick layer of concrete or

ee

other material that surrounds the reactor vessel. It protects workers and the environment from
radiations emitted by the reactor.

Enrichment of Uranium

The uranium found in nature has different isotopes and each isotope has different properties
and characteristics. Every isotope of uranium is not equally favorable for the nuclear fission
chain reaction. Uranium usually has two main isotopes i.e., Uranium-235 and Uranium-238.
About 99.3% of natural uranium is U-238 but unluckily it is not directly fissile but it can capture
neutrons and can be converted into plutonium-239 (Pu-239) which is fissile. On the other hand,
uranium-235 is about 0.7% of natural uranium and this isotope is fissile means it can sustain a
chain reaction by absorbing neutrons and undergoes fission. Hence uranium fuel needs to be
enriched because natural uranium contains too low concentration of fissile U-235. Enrichment
increases the proportion of U-235 allowing reactors to achieve and maintain criticality, operate
efficiently, manage reactor design and fuel usage effectively.

The process of converting non fissile material like uranium-238 into a fissile material like
uranium-235 is called enrichment.

To sustain a controlled nuclear chain reaction a reactor needs a sufficient concentration of
fissile material i.e. U-235 in nature its concentration is as low as 0.7% which is not sufficient
and nuclear reactor cannot be run on this percentage. Enriched uranium typically contains 3-
5% U-235 due to this higher concentration of U-235 it improves the efficiency of reactor making
it more feasible to maintain a steady and controlled reaction.

Various methods can be used to enrich uranium including gaseous diffusion method, as shown
in Fig. 22.18, gas centrifugation and laser enrichment. The most common method is gas
centrifugation which uses rapidly spinning centrifuges to separate uranium isotopes based on
difference in their masses.

The gas centrifugation process is shown in Fig. 22.19, in which a motor rotates the case which

molecules, gradually increasing the concentration of U-235. This process is repeated multiple
times to achieve the desired level of enrichment.

22.7 ENERGY IN ANNIHILATION REACTIONS ~ -

Annihilation reactions are fundamental in particle physics and have practical applications in
technologies like PET Scans in medical imaging. It occurs when a particle collides with its
corresponding anti-particle resulting their mutual destruction and conversion of their mass into
energy. This process is governed by the principles of conservation of momentum and mass-
energy means total energy before and after the annihilation remains the same, as described by
Einstein’s equation E =m c?. The total momentum also conserves in these reactions i.e. the

total momentum of photons will be equal to the initial momentum of the particle and anti-
particle. The most common example of annihilation reaction is electron-positron annihilation
to produce two gamma ray photons and can be given as:

e+e'=Y+y (22.2)
Another annihilation reaction can be of proton and anti-proton in which they annihilate to
produce photons or various other particles like pion and kaon, such reactions can be given as:

The energy in electron-positron Figure 22.19: Proton anti-proton annihilation,
annihilation given by equation (22.2) can
be calculated as:

The rest mass energy of an electron can be found by using equation E=m,c* while the rest

mass of an electron and positron is 9.1107’ kg . Now to calculate the rest mass energy of the
electron and positron we can use:

E=m,c’+m,c = 2hf

E=m,c = 9.1«x10™'kg x (3x10°ms'y

or E=mc = 8.1910 "J
This energy can be converted into electron-volt units as:
8.19x10 "

As positron has the same mass as that of electron hence it also has the same energy so total
energy of the annihilating particles can be given as:

E= 2511875 eV =1.02 MeV
This is minimum.amount of energy produced by the annihilation reaction. Hence each gamma
ray photon carries energy of 0.51 MeV. For the case when electron and positron are moving

--- PAGE 164 ---
then their kinetic energy is also included in the total energy which determines the energy of
the emitted gamma ray photons and can be written as:

KE seen + KE stron + 2M,C? = 2hf
Example 22.8. Find the amount of energy released by the annihilation of electron and

positron initially moving with kinetic energy of 0.12 MeV each, while the rest mass energy
of electron and positron is 0.51 MeV.

Given: Rest mass energy of electron: mc? =0.51 MeV

(22.3)

Rest mass energy of positron: m,c’ = 0.51 MeV
K.Esectron = 0-12 MeV K.E, stron = 0-12 MeV
To Find: Energy of gamma ray photon: Af =?
Solution: To find energy we use equation 22.15:
K.Eeectrot #/K-Excstron + 2M,C2 = 2hf
Putting values, we get: 0.12) MeV+ 0.12 MeV+ 2x(0.51 MeV) = 2hf

or 1.26 MeV = 2hf

or hf = 0.63 MeV

Hence the energy of each gamma ray photon will be 0.63 MeV.

Radiations have vast medical treatment and diagnostics applications. The most commonly used
radiations you would ever use are the medical x-rays, gamma ray therapy and other radiations.
These are widely used for different.purposes in medical science. Medical tracer and PET scanner
are some of the techniques commonly used in medical diagnostics.

22.8.1 Medical Tracer

A medical tracer is a substance which
contains some radioactive nuclei. It is used in
medical imaging to study the functions of
tissues and organs. When we introduce this
substance into the body the tracer is
absorbed by the specific tissue being
examined, as shown in Fig. 22.20. The
radioactive nuclei emit gamma rays which can Detect tumour from the flow

(SPECT) scanners. These images help doctors diagnose and monitor various conditions such as
cancer, heart disease and neurological disorders by providing detailed information about the
processes occurring within the body. The tracer is usually introduced into the body through
injection into the blood stream, ingestion or inhalation depending upon the type of study and
the area of interest. When tracer enters into the body it is absorbed by specific tissues due to
its affinity for certain biological processes. Tracers are valuable in research settings to study
how diseases develop and progress as well as to explore new treatments and diagnostic
methods. There are many radioactive materials which are used as medical tracers depending
upon the need of study and their properties required. Some of the commonly used materials as

travels through the blood stream and accumulates in tissues or organs which are under
studies.

Electromagnetic radiations are playing a vital role in facilitating us during research. It can give
us in depth information of a living or non-living body by penetrating into it. Electromagnetic
radiations also give us information of far-off outer space or universe.

Electromagnetic energy travels in the form of waves and spans a broad spectrum ranging from
very long radio waves to very short gamma rays. The human eye can only detect a small portion
of this spectrum, called visible light. NASA's scientific instruments use the full range of the
electromagnetic spectrum to study the Earth, the solar system, and the universe beyond.

Cosmology is the study of the origin, development, structure, history, and future of the entire
universe. Radiation plays a significant role in cosmology, particularly in understanding residual

radiation from the Big Bang. These aspects help us study the universe's origins, evolution, and
structure.

23.1 BLACK BODY RADIATION

A black-body is an ideal object which is perfectly opaque and non-
reflecting.

e It absorbs all the radiation that falls on it.
e tis also a good emitter.

A black-body is a theoretical object; however, stars are the best
examples. The radiation emitted from a black-body has a
characteristic spectrum that is determined by the temperature.

emission spectra. It shows that hotter objects emit shorter
wavelengths (e.g., blue light), while cooler objects emit longer wavelengths (e.g., red light).

Wien’s displacement law relates the observed wavelength of light emitted by a star to its
surface temperature (T). It states that:

The black body radiation curve for different temperatures peaks at a wavelength, which is
inversely proportional to the temperature. ~

- This relation can be written as: T

ue
d= constant x —
or os | T

Amax is the maximum wavelength emitted by the star-at the peak intensity, as shown in Fig.

23.2. Here the constant is equal to 2.9 x 10° m K. Thus, the equation for Wien’s displacement
law is given by:

Amax T = 2.9 x 10° mK (23.1)
This equation shows that:

23,2 LUMINOSITY AND RADIANT FLUX INTENSITY

| A i etal anise CRRA ARL” LEMIRE AEROS SS
Luminosity and radiant flux intensity are two different quantities related to electromagnetic
radiation. Let us understand each term separately, before exploring the relationship between
them.

Luminosity

ate n Som
In astronomy, luminosity is the total amount of electromagnetic energy emitted per unit time
by a star or other celestial objects. This represents the power output.of radiation emitted by a

star.

Luminosity is a measure-of the total power output of radiation emitted. by a star.

In SI units, luminosity is measured in joule per second (J s"), or watt (W).

Luminosity depends on temperature and surface area of the star. The relationship between
these two quantities is known as the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that:

The total energy emitted by a blackbody per unit area per second is proportional to the fourth
power of the absolute temperature of the body.

National Book Foundation ' ) 23-Cosmology

--- PAGE 173 ---
“~

When considering a star to be a completely black body, the Stefan-Boltzmann law can be
applied to find the value for luminostty (L) for a black body. i.e.,

L = AoT* (23.2 a)

Where A is the surface area, T is the temperature (in kelvins) and o is the Stefan-Boltzmann
constant, with a value of 5.67 x 10° Wm K™. The surface area of a star (being sphere) is equal
to 4nr*, so Eq. (23.2 a) can also be written as:

L = 4nroT* (23.2 b)

If two stars have same temperature, then the star with double radius will have approximately
four times the luminosity.

Radiant Flux Intensity

Light sources (such as stars) that are further away from the Earth appear fainter because the
light they emit is spread out over a larger area. The moment the light leaves the surface of the
star, it begins to spread out uniformly through a spherical shell (with an area of 4mr’). The
radius r of this sphere is equal to the distance d between the star and the Earth. By the time
the radiation reaches the Earth, it has been spread over an area of 4nd’.

The luminosity per unit area measured on the surface of the Earth is known as radiant flux
intensity.

Thus, the relationship between the luminosity (L) and radiant flux intensity (F) can be expressed
as: ,

F=L/A (23.3 a) oo
L :

where A is the area of the illuminated surface. In SI units, »
radiant flux intensity is measured in W m*. Eq. (23.3) shows
that the radiant flux follows an inverse square law: when
light is twice as far away, it has spread over four times the
area, resulting in a four-fold decrease in intensity.

For Your information

Consider a point source of light of luminosity L that radiates
equally in all directions, as shown in Fig. 23.3. A
hollow sphere centered on the point would have its entire
interior surface illuminated. As the radius increases, the
surface area also increases, and the constant luminosity has ~ Value of solar luminosity is:
more surface area to illuminate, leading to a decrease in 3.84 x 10% W
observed brightness (radiant flux intensity).

A greater radiant flux intensity (larger F) indicates that the star is closer to the Earth
(smaller d).

The luminosity is the total power output of the star, whereas the radiant flux intensity is what
is measured on Earth.

a3. STANDARD CANDLES: A Distance Indicator

Measuring astronomical distances accurately is an extremely difficult task. A direct distance
measurement is only possible if the object is close enough to the Earth. For more distant
objects, indirect methods must be used. Standard candles are useful for this purpose.

National Book Foundation 23-Cosmology

--- PAGE 175 ---
In astronomy, a. standard candle is a source with a known luminosity. A standard candle is
defined as:

An astronomical object which has a known luminosity due to a characteristic quality possessed
by that class of object.

If the luminosity of a source (i.e., standard candle) is For Your!
known, then the distance can be calculated by using the Eq.
(23.3 b), which is based on how bright (i.e., the
measured radiant flux intensity) it appears from Earth.

Examples of standard candles are: Cepheid variable stars
and Type 1A supernovae. Each standard candle method can
measure distances within a certain range. Organizing the

data and measurements from each method allows pend ge ay en -
astronomers to build up a larger picture of the universe, “nebulae” and derive the Hubble
from nearby stars to. distant galaxies. This is known as aw. Nebulae are interstellar
the cosmic distance ladder. Clouds of gas and dust.

Estimating the Radius of Stars

The radius of a star can be estimated by combining Wien’s displacement law and the Stefan-
Boltzmann law. The procedure for this is as follows:

e Find the surface temperature of the star by using Wien’s displacement law.

e Find the luminosity of the star by using the inverse square law of flux (if the radiant flux
and stellar distance are given).

e Then, using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the stellar radius can be obtained.

Example 23.2: The spectrum of the star Rigel in the constellation of Orion peaks at a
wavelength of 263 nm, while the spectrum of the star Betelgeuse peaks at a wavelength of
828 nm. Find the surface temperature of-these two stars. Which of these two stars is cooler?

Given: For the star Rigel: Amax = 263 nm = 263 x 10%m

For the star Betelgeuse: . Amax = 828 nm = 828 x 10°m
To Find: Surface temperature for the star Rigel: T =?

Surface temperature-for the star Betelgeuse: T =?
Which of the two stars is cooler =?
Solution: We use the equation,
Amax T = 2:9 x 10% mK _
By rearrange for distanced, we get:
T = 2.9 « 107 / Nmax

For the star Rigel: T =2.9 x 10? / Amex = 2.9 x 107 / 263 x 10° = 11026 K
For the star Betelgeuse: T =2.9 x 10° / Amax = 2.9 x 10° / 828 x 10° = 3502 K
As, Betelgeuse has surface temperature of 3500 K, therefore, it is cooler than Rigel.

Betelgeuse rs to the radius of the Sun r;.

23.4 SPECTRA OF LIGHT

Astronomers are very limited in how they can investigate objects in the space. All of the
techniques used by astronomers involve analysing the light emitted from the star, or galaxy.
One of these techniques involves analysing the emission and absorption spectra of stars.

Elements in the star (mostly hydrogen and helium) absorb some of the emitted wavelengths.
Therefore, characteristic lines are present when the spectrum is analysed. Every element has
a unique set of absorption and emission lines. The pattern of lines is known as a spectral
signature. The absorption and emission spectra of each element are inverses of each other: The
wavelengths of a particular*element’s absorption lines are the same as the wavelengths of its
emission lines. Astronomers can compare the spectrum of a celestial object or material with
the spectra of known elements and molecules to figure out what the object or material is made
of.

Absorption Spectra: When light passes through a gas, atoms and molecules in the gas absorb
certain colors, or wavelengths, of that light. The result is an absorption spectrum: a rainbow
with dark absorption lines.

Emission Spectra: The same gas can glow, giving off very specific colors to form an emission
spectrum with bright lines known as emission lines:

Spectra of Light from Stars and Galaxies

When astronomers observe light from distant galaxies, they observe differences in the spectral
lines to the light from the Sun. The lines in the emission and absorption spectra from distant
objects show an increase in wavelength from their known values. These lines appear to be
shifted sightly towards the red end of the spectrum but the lines have the same characteristic
pattern, meaning the element can still be easily identified.

--- PAGE 177 ---
Red-shift and Speed

Astronomers see red-shift in all galaxies. It is due to the reason that ‘the space between the
Earth and the galaxies is expanding’. This expansion has the effect of increasing the wavelength
of the light from these galaxies, shifting them towards the red end of the spectrum. The more
red-shifted the light from a galaxy is, the faster the galaxy is moving away from Earth. Recall
that the Doppler effect is defined as:

There is apparent change in wavelength or frequency of the radiation from a source due to its
relative motion toward or away from the observer.

Doppler effect of light can observe when spectra of distant stars and galaxies are observed,
this is known as:

e Redshift, if the object is moving away from the Earth.
e Blueshift, if the object is moving towards the Earth.
Redshift is defined as:

The fractional increase in wavelength (or decrease in frequency) due to the source and observer
receding from each other.

Red-shift can be calculated using:

el” @
— €
Where, AA is shift in wavelength, A is wavelength emitted from the source, Af is shift in

frequency, f is frequency emitted from the source, v is speed of recession and c is ion of
light in a vacuum.

Expanding Universe

After the discovery of Doppler redshift, astronomers began to realise that almost all the galaxies
in the universe are receding. This led to the idea that the space between the Earth and the
galaxies must be expanding. This expansion stretches out the light waves as they travel through
space, shifting them towards the red end of the spectrum. The more red-shifted the light from .
a galaxy is, the faster the gataxy is moving away from Earth.

galaxies move away from each other.

23.5 HUBBLE’S LAW AND THE BIG BANG THEORY

Edwin Hubble investigated the
light spectra emitted from a
large number of galaxies. He
used redshift data to determine
the galaxy'’s recessional velocity
(v), andstandard candles to
determine the distances (d)
between the galaxy and Earth.
From these measurements, he
formulated a relationship, now
known as Hubble’s Law.

Hubble’s Law states:

is directly proportional to its
distance from the Earth.

Expression for the Hubble’s Law
can be written as:

Where, H, is Hubble's constant,

universe (s"). The Eq. (23.5)
shows that:

Age of the Universe

If the galaxies are moving away from each other, then they must've started from the same
point at some time in the past, as shown in Fig. 23.7. If this is true, the universe likely began
in an extremely hot, dense singular point which subsequently began to expand very quickly.
This idea is known as the Big Bang theory. According to the Big Bang theory:

About 13.8 billion years ago the whole
universe was a very small, extremely hot
and dense region. From this tiny point, the
whole universe expanded outwards to
what exists today.

Redshift of galaxies and the expansion of
the universe are now some of the most
prominent pieces of evidence to suggest
this theory is true. The data from Hubble’s
law can be extrapolated back to'the point
where the universe started expanding,
i.e., the beginning of the universe, as
shown in Fig. 23.7. Therefore, the age of
the universe T, is equal to:

Figure 23.7: Tracing the expansion of the universe
back to the beginning of time leads to the idea the

°
Presently estimated age of the universe ranges from 13 to 14 billion years. There is still some
discussion about the exact age of the universe, therefore, finding accurate measurements for
the Hubble’s constant is a top priority for cosmologists.

relation to the Earth? Is it moving towards or away from the Earth?

To Find: Speed of the galaxy: v =?
Solution: Shift in frequency: Af = (4.570 - 4.547) = 10 = 2.3 x 10" Hz

--- PAGE 184 ---
Understanding Earth’s climate system is a complex interplay of various components that
collectively determine the average weather conditions over time. Each component contributes
its unique role to the global climate equilibrium. From the depths of oceans to the heights of
the atmosphere, from the microscopic interactions of atoms and molecules to the grand
movements of continents every facet of Earth’s system influences and influenced by the
climate. One of the key ingredients of this system is the radiant energy received from the Sun.
This solar energy powers Earth’s atmospheric circulations, ocean currents and the hydrological
cycle shaping the distribution of heat and moisture across the planet. The composition of the
atmosphere is primarily made up of gases like nitrogen, oxygen and greenhouse gases such as
carbon dioxide and methane. Methane acts like a blanket, trapping some of incoming solar
radiations and regulate the planet’s temperature. The Earth’s surface, with its diverse
landscapes of oceans, ice caps, forests, deserts and urban areas play a significant role in
modulating climate patterns. These surfaces absorb, reflect and emit radiations differently
leading the complex patterns of temperature and precipitation across the globe. Meanwhile the
biosphere which contains all living organism interact with the climate system through processes
like photosynthesis, respiration and the release of greenhouse gases. In unrevealing the
complexities of Earth’s climate system, scientists employ a multitude of tools and techniques
from satellite observations and computer models to field experiments and climate
reconstructions. Through continuous advancements in technology our understanding of the
Earth’s climate system continues to evolve.

and argon which is 0.9%. Additionally, there are trace gases such as, water vapors (H20), carbon
dioxide (CO2), ozone (O3) and methane (CH,). These trace gases play a significant role in the
climate system. ‘
The role of the atmosphere is the shielding: as it protects life on Earth by shielding it from
incoming ultraviolet radiations. It insulates the planet as it keeps the planet warm by acting as

an insulating layer. The atmosphere prevents extreme temperature variations between day and
night. It is responsible for convection and weather patterns as the solar heating causes layers
of the atmosphere to convert, driving the air movement and influencing global weather
patterns. Some trace gases like carbon dioxide and water vapors act as greenhouse gases. These
gases allow visible light from the Sun to penetrate to the surface but block some of infrared
radiations emitted by the Earth’s surface which traps heat within the atmosphere contributing
to the overall warming effect. The atmosphere is divided into different layers depending upon
their altitude and functioning, as shown in
Fig. 24.2.

e Troposphere: The lowest layer
extending from the ground (the
surface of the Earth) to about 16 km.
It’s the layer where weather occurs.

e Stratosphere: Above the troposphere,
from 16 km to 50 km, is the
stratosphere. The ozone layer is found
here which prevents us from the
harmful ultraviolet radiations coming
from the Sun.

e Mesosphere: Above the s
from 50 km to 136 km is the
mesosphere. Meteors burn out in this
part of the atmosphere.

e Thermosphere: Above the

» mesosphere from 136 km up to about
600 km is the thermosphere. It is
where the auroras occur due to solar
radiations.

e Exosphere: The exosphere is outer
most layer into which extends from
600 km up to merging into the space.
Satellites orbit in this region.

2) The Hydrosphere (Water)

The hydrosphere encompasses all the water on the Earth whether it is in liquid water, solid ice
or the gaseous water (vapors form). The Earth contains 70 % water on its surface. Most of the
hydrosphere consists of liquid water primarily found in the oceans. Our planet’s abundant
surface waters give Earth its distinct appearance as a blue globe and set it different from the
all-other planets in the solar system. Some of the characteristics of hydrosphere are:

e The hydrosphere plays a critical role in regulating Earth’s climate.

e It influences patterns of precipitation and affects the movement of energy throughout the
climate system.

e Ocean currents, evaporation and condensation are all parts of hydrological cycle which
redistributes the water around the planet.

rivers or lakes and also the
water which infiltrates into the groundwater).

3) The Cryosphere (Ice)

The cryosphere refers to any place on Earth where water is in its solid form, where low
temperatures freeze water and turn it into ice. The frozen water can be found in the form of
solid ice or snow and occurs in many places around the Earths The cryosphere exists in the
polar-regions but is also found wherever snow, sea ice, glaciers, permafrost, ice sheets and
icebergs exist. In Pakistan, the examples of cryosphere are the ice caped mountains and glaciers
in the Himalaya, Karakorum and Hindu Kush Mountain ranges in the north, Snow and ice are the
basic elements of the cryosphere as they interact throughout Earth’s different environments to
create sea ice, glaciers, ice shelves, icebergs and frozen ground. Although direct measurement
of the cryosphere can be difficult to obtain due to the remote locations of many of these areas,
satellite observations help scientists monitor changes in the global and regional climate by
observing how regions of the Earth’s cryosphere shrink and expand. Some of the components of
the cryosphere are explained as:

e Snow: Snow is the precipitation that forms when water vapors freeze into ice crystals. It
can form whenever there is high humidity and cold temperatures in the atmosphere.
Because of its reflective property it regulates the climate by reflecting incoming sunlight
back into the space and hence cooling the planet

¢ Ice: Ice forms when liquid water becomes a solid at temperatures below the freezing point,
It is the part of sea ice, glaciers, ice shelves, icebergs and frozen ground. The ice in polar-
regions has important impact on polar regions and Earth’s climate. The sea ice layer

--- PAGE 187 ---
increases the salinity of sea water. It also restricts wind and wave action near coastlines. It
also reflects much of the sunlight into the space back. Ice currently covers 10 percent of
the Earth’s surface and is disappearing rapidly

Permafrost: Permafrost refers to permanently frozen ground found mainly in high altitude
regions. It contains ice and soil that remain frozen for extended periods.

The components of cryosphere are shown in Fig. 24.4.

Figure 24.4: Crvosphere, _

4) The Lithosphere (Earth’s Upper Rocky Layer)

The lithosphere is the outermost solid shell of the Earth consisting of the crust and the

uppermost: part of the mental. It composed of various types of rocks and minerals. The
lithosphere interacts with other components such as the atmosphere, hydrosphere and
biosphere. Some important features of lithosphere are as:

Land surface: The lithosphere provides the surface on which climate processes occur.
Different types of land surfaces have different influences on the Earth’s climate for example
forests can moderate the temperatures while deserts tend to have extreme temperature
fluctuations.

Carbon cycle: Lithosphere plays a major role in carbon cycle which is essential for
regulating Earth's climate. Rocks weather and erode over time releasing carbon dioxide into
the atmosphere. On the other hand, some types of rocks like lime stone are carbon sinks

' which takes carbon from the atmosphere over a geological time scale.

Tectonic Activity: Processes like tectonics, which involves the movement and interaction
of lithosphere plates, can have significant impact on climate over a large timescale. Due to
movement of tectonic plates mountain ranges are formed which affect atmospheric
circulation patterns and precipitation distribution influencing regional climate.

Volcanic Activity: Volcanic eruption which is related to tectonic activity can release large
number of gases and particles into the atmosphere these emissions can temporarily cool the
climate by blocking sunlight, leading to short term cooling events known as “volcanic

* winters”

The movement of tectonic plates and volcano formation is shown in Fig. 24.5.

5) The Biosphere (Living Things) { Sunlight! 9" aan |

The biosphere refers to the relatively thin
life supporting layer of Earth’s surface. It
extends from a few kilometers into the
atmosphere to the deep-sea vents in the
ocean. Biosphere deals with the living things
and their impact on the Earth’s climate
system. It consists of living organisms
(plants, animals, fungi and microorganisms)
and the non-living factors from which they
derive energy and nutrients. The role of
biosphere in the Earth’s climate system can
be given as:

Climate regulation: The biosphere plays
a crucial role in regulating the Earth’s
climate. Changes in the biosphere can
directly impact climate patterns
Carbon cycle: The biosphere is an integral
reservoir in the carbon cycle. Through
processes like photosynthesis living organisms
absorb carbon dioxide (CO) from the
atmosphere and convert it into organic matter.
The carbon cycle is shown in Fig. 24.6 (a).
Energy flow: Solar energy is captured by the
plants during photosynthesis and this energy

Example 24.1: Find the change in storage of hydrosphere in terms of volume whose area of

runoff are 60 mm and 30 mm respectively.
Given: Area of watershed = A = 120 km? Precipitation = P = 110 mm
Evapotranspiration = E = 60 mm Runoff = Q = 30 mm
To Find: Change in storage: AS =?
Solution: First of all we have to find the volumes of all these using:

Precipitation volume = P x A

P, =0.11 mx120,000,000 m?* or P, = 13,200,000 m?
Now Evapotrans portation volume = Ex A

E, =0.06 mx 120,000,000 m? or E, = 7,200,000 m*
Also Roundoff volume = QxA

Q, =0.03 mx120,000,000 m?* or Q, =3,600,000 m?
Now to calculate the change in storage volume, we use:

AS, =P, -E, -Q,
Putting values: AS, = 13,200,000 m? — 7,200,000 m* — 3,600,000 m*

Find the precipitation in mm if the change in storage of water is 20 mm, while
evapotransportation is 50 mm and runoff is 30 mm.

24.2 OCEAN CURRENTS AND WINDS

Ocean currents and wind patterns are interconnected phenomenon that play crucial role in
regulating the Earth’s climate and distribute heat around the globe.

Ocean currents are the continuous, predictable and directional movement of seawater driven
by gravity, wind and water density. Ocean water moves in two directions i.e. horizontally and
vertically. Horizontal movements are called as currents while vertical changes are called up-
welling and down-welling. The movement of ocean water is continuous and is broadly
categorized into three types i.e., waves, tides and currents. Ocean currents can be defined as:

The streams of water that flow constantly on the ocean surface in definite directions are called
ocean currents.

Ocean currents help distribute heat globally influencing climate patterns. They carry nutrients
and food to marine organisms supporting sea life. Ocean currents can be categorized into two
group i.e. surface ocean currents and deep ocean currents.

1) Surface Ocean Currents

The ocean currents which produced on shallower waters near the surface are called surface
ocean currents. These currents are produced due to various factors like:

National Book Foundation Ge9) 24-Earth’s Climate”

--- PAGE 190 ---
e Wind: Major surface ocean currents are primarily set in motion by the wind. As the wind
blows across the ocean surface it drags the water along with it creating currents.

¢ Subtropical Gyres: Large rotating currents that start near the equator are called subtropical
gyres. These gyres transfer heat from the equator towards the poles helping moderate
climate and concentrating plastic trash in certain areas of the ocean.

Coriolis Effect

The rotation of Earth influences the
path of these currents. A_ force
resulting from the Earth’s rotation is
called coriolis force. In the northern
hemisphere predictable winds called
trade winds blow from east to west just
above the equator. These winds pull
surface water and the Coriolis effect
deflects the currents. Then they bend
to the right heading north. At about 30
degrees north latitude another set of
winds called westerlies push the Figure 24.7: Coriolis force.

currents back to the east creating a

closed clockwise loop. Similar patterns.occur in the southern hemisphere but currents in this
side are counter-clock wise i.e. bend to the left, as shown in Fig. 24.7.

2) Deep Ocean Currents

The ocean currents beyond the depth of 500 meters are known as deep ocean currents. These
currents are formed due to the differences in temperature and density of the water in different
parts of the ocean. Some of them are explained below.

e Warm Water Northward: The surface currents carry warm water north from the equator as
this water moves into higher northern latitudes it cools down

e Density: The density of sea water plays a major role in producing ocean currents and
circulating heat as cooling process increases ‘he water’s denstv. Sea water density varies
due to its salinity and temperature, Ss. :
high salinity makes water denser
because more salt is packed into it. mati
Denser water sinks and flows back ped
toward the equator at deeper levels
creating deep ocean currents. On
the other hand, high temperature
makes the water less dense. Near
the ocean surface a combination of
high salinity and low temperature

makes water dense enough to sink
into deep-ocean. The weight of Figure 24.8: Water movement due to density
difference.

“National Book Foundation 24-Earth’s Climate

--- PAGE 191 ---
water above pushes deep water molecules together making them denser. Deep circulation
affects the entire ocean and significantly impacts abyssal properties (abyssal is the region
in deep oceans where there is no light and very little oxygen with very high concentration
of salts and density, this region has very few examples of life in it) where wind driven
currents have no effect. The movement of water due to density is shown in Fig. 24.8.

Thermohaline Circulation

The Deep Ocean currents are caused by differences in water density. This process is called
thermohaline circulation where “thermo” refers to temperature and “haline” to saltiness.
Thermohaline circulation is a large-scale ocean circulation driven by density gradients created
by surface heat and freshwater fluxes. The wind driven surface currents move toward poles
from the equatorial region and cool the water during their movement and this cooled water
sinks at high latitudes and this cycle continues which transport energy and mass. Thermohaline
circulations act like a giant conveyor belt moving warm surface waters downward and forcing
cold nutrient rich deep waters upward, as shown in Fig. 24.9.

Earth’s Angular Momentum and Wind Patterns

The conservation of angular momentum plays a crucial role in determining the wind patterns
on the Earth. This is closely related to the Earth’s rotation and is responsible for the Coriolis
effect which deflects the movement of air masses in different directions depending on the
hemisphere. Angular momentum is a property of rotating objects depends upon velocity of
rotation and the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation. Due to this phenomenon the
air moves from high latitudes (mear the poles) to low latitudes (towards the equator). It
experiences a change in velocity due to Earth’s spherical shape and varying rotational speeds.
The turning of winds due to the rotation of Earth is called as Coriolis effect, as shown in Fig.

24.7, and the force which bends the winds due to change in speeds is called as Coriolis force
which can be given as:

F. = 2mve sin® (24.2)

Here ‘F.’ is the Coriolis force, ‘m’ is the mass of the moving air packet, ‘v’ is the wind speed,
‘w’ is the angular velocity of the Earth’s rotation (which is approximately 7.292x10° rads")

and ‘8’ is the angle with latitude (at equator it is 0° while at poles it is +90°)

National Book Foundation 24-Earth'’s Climate

--- PAGE 192 ---
At the equator the Coriolis force is zero due to sin0° = 0, while this force is maximum at the

poles due to sin90° = 1. The Coriolis effect causes winds to be deflected more strongly at the
higher latitudes closer to the poles. It is important to note that the magnitude of wind speed
is not directly influenced by the Coriolis force but the direction of the wind will change
significantly as we move from equator towards the pole.

As from the equator where the distance of the surface of Earth from the axis of rotation is large
i.e., it has large moment of inertia at this point, here the speeds of winds will be low but near
poles the moment of inertia becomes small and hence increases the speed of winds. This
difference in the speed of winds accounts for the weather patterns on Earth. The deflection of
, air due to Coriolis effect helps to create distinct atmospheric circulation cells as shown in Fig.
* 24.10. ,

Figure 24,10: Wind circulation cells.

e Hadley Cells: Between the equator and 30° latitude, warm air rises at the equator due to
intense heating and moves towards poles at high altitudes and finally descends around 30°
latitude creating a cycle.

e Ferrell Cells: Between 30° to 60° latitude air descends around 30° and moves towards pole
at the surface and rises at 60° latitude with movement towards equator at high altitudes.

e Polar Cells: Between 60° latitude and the poles air rises at 60° latitude and moves towards
pole at high altitude. Finally; air descends at the pole.

These cells distribute heat and moisture around the globe which influences weather patterns
and climate.

Wind patterns are integral components of the climate system playing a significant role in
shaping regional and global climate. Wind patterns are the result of complex interactions
between various atmospheric and oceanic processes. They are necessary for distribution of
heat, moisture and energy across the Earth’s surface influencing weather conditions and
climate for both short and long timescales. The basic relationship between atmospheric

pressure and horizontal wind can be described using the geostrophic balance.

National Book Foundation 24-Earth’s Climate

--- PAGE 193 ---
This balance occurs when we disregard friction and changes in wind direction and speed. The
geostrophic wind blows parallel to isobars and is influenced by two main forces as:

e Horizontal pressure gradient force (the change in pressure measured across a given distance
is called a pressure gradient) derives the air movement from higher to lower pressure areas.

e Coriolis force results from the Earth’s rotation and causes the deflection of wind to the right
in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere.

Wind speed increases as the distance between isobars decreases or pressure gradient increases.
The impact of wind on climate can be given as:

e Heat Transport: Wind carries heat from one region to another. For example, ocean currents
driven by wind transport warm water from the equator towards the poles.

e Moisture Transport: Wind transports moisture affecting precipitation patterns
(precipitation is any liquid or frozen water that forms in the atmosphere and falls back to
the Earth). Trade winds, westerlies and polar easterlies play essential roles in distributing
moisture globally. These winds on globe are shown in Fig. 24.10.

e Pollutant Dispersion: wind disperses pollutants like dust, smoke and industrial emissions
across the large area.

e Pollen Distribution: Wind help disperse pollen helping plant reproduction.

e Daily weather Patterns: Coastal regions experience daily changes in wind direction due to
differential heating of land and water (the difference in how land and water aateces absorb
heat is called as differential heating).

Over a 30-year period these wind patterns exhibit statistical regularities that contribute to the
climate of the region. Variations in these patterns over long-time scales can result in changes
to regional climate and even global climate. Understanding and monitoring wind patterns are
crucial for predicting weather events, mapping natural resources and assessing the impacts of
climate change. Advanced modeling techniques and observational technologies continue to
improve our understanding of these complex interactions within the climate system.

Oe The deflection increases

until the coriolis force is balanced by the pressure gradient force. At this point the wind will be blowing
parallel to the isobars (having same pressures) when this happens the wind is referred to as the

“geostrophic wind”.

Solution: First we need to convert the velocity into S! units as:

24.3 CLIMATE INERTIA

Climate inertia refers to the tendency of the Earth’s climate to resist or respond slowly to
changes in external factors like greenhouse gas concentrations and solar radiations. This
phenomenon occurs due to various complex feedback mechanisms and processes within the
Earth’s climate system. These feedback mechanisms include:

e Positive feedback: Some feedbacks amplify initial changes for example as the arctic ice
melts due to warming it reduces the Earth’s reflectivity leading to further warming.

¢ Negative feedback: Other feedbacks dampen changes for example increased carbon dioxide
(CO2) levels stimulate plant growth which absorbs some carbon acting as negative feedback.

The climate inertia is time dependent as for example if greenhouse gas emissions were to
stabilize immediately the Earth’s climate would continue to warm for some time due*to heat
already stored in the oceans. Climate processes operate on various timescales from days to
centuries like:

e Short-term Inertia: The ocean and land surfaces absorb and release heat relatively slowly
leading to short term inertia this is why daily temperature fluctuations occur

e Long-term Inertia: changes in greenhouse gas concentrations like carbon dioxide take
decades to centuries to fully impact the climate system. When we stabilize greenhouse gas
emission the climate system does not respond immediately.

Oceans play a main role in climate inertia as they have high heat capacity means they absorb
and release heat slowly. Changes in ocean temperature occur gradually affecting climate
patterns over extended periods. Similarly, the carbon cycle involves exchanges of carbon
dioxide between the atmosphere, oceans, land and vegetation. It.also takes time due to slow
decomposition of organic matter. The melting of ice sheets and glaciers contributes to sea level
rise but this process occurs over centuries leading to inertia in the response to climate change.
Climate inertia underscores the importance of adaptation (adjusting to existing changes) and
mitigation (reducing emission) strategies. Even if we take immediate actions the effects of past
emissions will persist. Earth’s climate change can be categorized into two main components
i.e. internal variations and external forcing.

24.3.2 External Forcing

External forcing refers to factors outside the climate system that influence the behavior of the
climate system. These factors can alter the Earth’s energy balance leading to long term climate
changes. Some of the examples of the external forcing are:

Greenhouse Gas Concentrations: Increased levels of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and
methane etc. due to human activities enhance the greenhouse effect trapping more heat and

causing global warming. Ageia

Solar Variability: Changes in solar output over
longer time scales impact Earth’s climate.

Orbital Variations: Earth’s orbit around the
Sun undergoes periodic variations.
Eccentricity and axial tilt affect the
distribution of solar energy, as shown in Fig.

External forcing factors operate over longer time frames like centuries and contribute to
gradual climate shifts.

24.4 EARTH ENERGY BUDGET

The Earth’s energy budget is a way of accounting for the balance between the energy that Earth
receives from the Sun and the energy it radiates back into the space. It is simple the balance
between the incoming solar radiation (insolation) and outgoing terrestrial radiations. The
Earth’s energy budget can have the components like:

e Incoming Solar radiations: The Sun emits energy in the form of sunlight. Approximately 49%
’ of this solar energy is absorbed by the Earth’s surface primarily by land, ocean and
vegetation,
e Atmospheric Absorption: About 20% of solar radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere itself.
e Outgoing Terrestrial Radiations: The Earth which absorbs radiation can also re-emit these
radiations as heat. This process occurs through infrared radiations emitted by the surface
and the atmosphere.

The greenhouse effect also plays a role in the energy distribution in the Earth’s climate in
regulating the globe’s temperature. It involves’ the interaction of solar radiation with
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It can be explained in terms of steps like in first step
sunlight penetrates the atmosphere and warms the Earth’s surface. In second step the heated
surface of the Earth emits infrared radiations. In third step greenhouse gases absorb some of
these outgoing radiations preventing them from escaping directly into the space. Instead, they
re-radiate part of this energy back towards the surface effectively trapping heat. Without the
greenhouse effect Earth’s average temperature would be well below freezing.

24.4.1 Solar Variability and Climate

While the Sun is essential for maintaining Earth’s habitable conditions, its influence on climate

change is relatively small compared to other factors. Some of the factors are as follows:

* Solar Cycles: The Sun undergoes 11-years solar cycles during which its activity varies. These
cycles affect solar radiation, sunspots and solar flares.

e Long-term Trends: Over the past 40-years satellites have observed the Sun’s energy output.
However, changes in solar activity account for less than 0.1% of the warming observed since
1750.

* Human Induced Warming: Human activities particularly the burning of fossil fuels release
greenhouse gases. The warming caused by these gases is over 270 times greater than any
sunlight warming from the Sun itself during the same period.

24.4.2 Energy Imbalance

The uneven distribution of solar energy across the Earth’s surface creates an energy imbalance.
The energy imbalance on the Earth is the main cause of the atmospheric circulations. For
example, equator receives more solar energy due to direct sunlight while the pole regions
receive less solar energy due to oblique sunlight, as shown in Fig, 24,13,

This energy imbalance drives the atmospheric circulations as:

--- PAGE 197 ---
e Warm air rises at the equator creating low-pressure zones.

e Cooler air sinks at the poles forming high pressure zones.

consequences.

24.4.3 Climate Science as a Chaotic System

Climate science provides a fascinating example of a chaotic system. In a chaotic system there
is no equilibrium and no repeatable patterns emerge. Chaotic systems exhibit extreme
sensitivity to initial conditions. This means that even small changes in the starting conditions
can lead to vastly different outcomes over time. Climate being a complex and interconnected
system can exhibit chaotic behavior as we often think of climate as having predictable seasons
and weather patterns (like the news inform us about a rain today but it does not happen) it can
also undergo sudden and rapid changes due to chaotic dynamics.

Butterfly Effect: Consider the metaphor of a butterfly flapping its wings in one part of the
world then according to chaos theory this seemingly insignificant event could potentially set
off a chain reaction of interactions that eventually lead to a hurricane forming in another part
of world, this phenomenon is popularly known as the “butterfly effect”. The butterfly effect

illustrates how small perturbations can amplify and propagate through a complex system
ultimately influencing large scale events.

Predictability and Uncertainty: Climate scientists sometimes refer to the effects of chaos as
intrinsic or unforced variability. These are unpredictable changes arising from dynamic
interactions within the climate system rather than being directly caused by external factors.
Our atmosphere and oceans do not behave in simple easily predictable ways they are non-linear
chaotic systems. As a result, we can only predict large-scale weather features with relative

National Book Foundation 24-Earth’s Climate

ee a ee ¥

certainty and only for a few days in advance. In this scenario the weather forecasting for an
extended time period is less reliable, these predictions may be more reliable only for short
time scale afterward.

Climate science exemplifies the delicate balance between predictability and chaos. While we
strive to understand and model climate dynamics the inherent complexity and sensitivity to
initial conditions remind us that some aspects of our climate remain inherently uncertain and
difficult to predict.

Earth’s climate system is a complex system with five interacting components the
atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the cryosphere, the lithosphere and the biosphere.
Hydrosphere encompasses all the water on the Earth whether it is in — water, solid ice
or the gaseous water vapors form.

Cryosphere refers to any place on Earth where water is in its solid form, where low
temperatures freeze water and turn it into ice.

Permafrost refers to permanently frozen ground found mainly in high altitude regions. It
contains ice and soil that remain frozen for extended periods.

Biosphere refers to the relatively thin life supporting layer of Earth’s surface. It extends

In medical, imaging is a range of tests used to create images of internal body parts. Medical
imaging seeks to reveal internal structures hidden by the skin and bones, as well as to diagnose
and treat disease. Medical imaging also creates a database of normal anatomy and physiology
to make it possible to identify abnormalities.

There are many different types of imaging techniques used in modern medicine, such as
ultrasound, X-rays, CT (computed tomography) scans, and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).
Each imaging type uses a different technology to create an image. In this unit, we'll discuss
some of the imaging techniques in detail.

25.1 PIEZOELECTRIC EFFECT AND ULTRASONIC WAVES

Piezoelectric effect is the ability of certain materials to generate an electric charge in response
to applied mechanical stress.

When piezoelectric. material is
placed under mechanical stress, a
shifting of the positive and
negative charges in the material
takes place, which then results in
an external electric field, as .
shown in Fig. 25.1 (a).

The piezoelectric effect is

reversible, as shown in Fig. 25.1
(b), it means that: Figure 25.1 (a): Piezoelectric effect.

The material can also generate stress when an electric field is applied. This is called inverse
piezoelectric effect. ;

Generation of ultrasound uses reverse piezoelectric effect.
In ultrasound equipment, a _ piezoelectric transducer
converts electrical energy into extremely rapid vibrations.
These vibrations are so fast that it makes sounds of too high-
pitched for our ears to hear.

When ultrasound waves hit an object and bounce back,
creating an echo. After reflection or scattering, ultrasonic
waves return to the detector causing the piezoelectric
materials to vibrate, which generate an electric signal to be
detected. In medical ultrasound, the detected signal
determines the shape, size, and consistency of the object,
generating a real-time image that appears on a screen. An
ultrasound image of the pancreas is shown in Fig. 25.1 (c).

Applications of Ultrasound in Medical

Medical technology uses ultrasound for many purposes.
Ultrasound is used to generate images of tissue and organs;
this technique is known as sonography or echography. The
great advantage of sonography over other imaging methods
in medical technology is that sound waves are
comparatively less harmful and can even be used for unborn
babies.

The ability to focus very intense ultrasonic waves in a small
region without disturbing the surrounding tissues provides a
very effective tool in neurosurgery. Special types of
ultrasonic equipment are in use for the treatment of
arthritics, muscular, rheumatism and sciatica.

An important industrial application is the ultrasonic flow
meter. Ultrasonic flow meters measure the flow rate of a
liquid by transmitting high-frequency sound waves into the
flowing liquid. The waves reflect off particles or bubbles in
the liquid, experiencing a frequency shift due to the liquid’s
flow velocity, known as the Doppler shift. This shift is
measured and used to calculate the flow rate. The meters
typically consist of transducers installed on the pipe, which
transmit and receive the ultrasound signals. The signals are
then processed to extract the Doppler shift information, and
the flow rate is calculated based on the pipe's cross-
sectional area.

This technique has also been applied to monitor blood flow

For Your information

Few animals such as bats and
frogs have the ability to use
ultrasound to communicate with
each other. Bats navigate and
find their food by echolocation.
Bats emit high pitched sound of
short wavelength in order to
navigate. These waves hit the
surrounding and bounce back
allowing bats to get an exact
map of the surrounding.

25.2 X-RAYS

X-rays originate from heavy atoms. Transitions of electrons between the shells in heavy atoms
produce X-rays. X-rays can also be produced by Coulomb interaction of a fast-moving electron
with orbital electrons as well as the positive nucleus. Let us see the production of X-rays in
detail.

Inner shell Transition and Characteristic X-Rays

The inner shell electrons in heavy atoms
are tightly bound. Large amount of energy
is required for the displacement of these
electrons from their normal energy levels. |
When a _ heavy. target material is | Kq X-ray
bombarded with a beam of electrons, that
has been accelerated by several k eV, |
some of these electrons will’collide with |
inner-shell electrons of the target and |
knock them out of their respective atoms
(Fig. 25.2.a).

Let.a K-shell electron is knocked out from

periodic table of elements.
When a high energy electron travels towards a target nucleus in the X-rays tube, it has coulomb
interaction with orbital electrons as well as the positive nucleus. The interaction with the
nucleus is very strong due of the presence of concentrated positive charge in the nucleus. The
force of attraction due to the large concentrated positive charge in the nucleus accelerates the
electron, as shown in Fig. 25.2 (b). The electron begins to decelerate as it moves away from
the nucleus. The decelerated electron emits radiation called Bremsstrahlung (a Germen word
meaning braking radiation). This Bremsstrahlung is called continues X-rays. Energy of the
electron decreases due to the emission of these radiations. According to quantum theory, these

--- PAGE 205 ---
radiations must appear in
the form of photons.
Since the radiated
photon carries energy,
the electron must lose
kinetic energy because of
its encounter with the

Actually, all radiation produced does not have the
wavelength given in equation (25.1) because many of
the electrons are not stopped in a single collision. This
results in the production of the continuous spectrum

molybdenum target is shown in Fig. 25.3.

The cathode is made of a filament which is heated by the current supplied from a battery.
Filament emits electrons. The anode is made of a solid copper bar. A high melting-point metal
like platinum or tungsten is embedded at end of the copper rod and it serve as a target. The
cathode and anode are enclosed inside an evacuated glass chamber. A high DC voltage of the
order of 50,000 V is maintained between cathode and anode.

The electrons emitted from the cathode are accelerated by the high potential difference. The
energetic electrons strike the target and X-rays are produced. When such highly energetic
electrons are suddenly stopped by target, an intense beam of X-rays is produced. A small part
of the kinetic energy of the incident electrons is converted into X-rays, the rest is converted
into heat. The target becomes very hot; therefore, it must have a high melting point. The heat
generated in target is dissipated through the copper rod. Sometime the anode is cooled by
water flowing behind the anode.

Applications of X-Rays in Imaging Internal Body Structures

X-ray imaging/photography is the most common and
oldest diagnostic imaging technique. During an X-ray
test, X-rays are allowed to pass through the body and
are absorbed in different quantities by different
organs. For example, the calcium content. in bones
means that they absorb x-rays better than. other tissue,
such as fat. An X-ray detector receives the X-rays after
they pass through the body, generating an image that
appears in shades of gray. The bones cast their shadow
on the photographic plate, as shown in Fig. 24.5. It is
because that bone is opaquer to X-rays than flesh. The
X-ray photographs reveal fractures of bones or the
presence of foreign bodies. Figure 25.5: X-ray image of hand.

Conventional X-ray image is sufficient when looking at t

bones and other dense structures, but there is difficulty while looking x-ray image of soft
tissues. For better evaluation of X-ray film of soft tissues, contrast is used in X-ray imaging.
Contrast is the range of brightness, from lightest to darkest, in an image. Contrast in X-ray
imaging allows the radiologist to evaluate structures that are not clearly evident on
conventional X-ray exams.

25.3 CT SCAN

A CT scan (Computed Tomography scan) is a medical imaging method that is useful to get a
detailed 3-D image of certain parts of the body, such as soft tissues, the blood vessels, the
lungs, the brain, abdomen, and bones etc. A CT scan machine uses X-rays and computer to get
image.

In the CT scanner there is an X-ray source and large number of detectors. Each detector records
an image. The source and the detectors are mounted on a large ring, as shown in Fig. 25.6.

National Book Foundation 25-Medical Imaging

--- PAGE 207 ---
During CT scan, the patient lies down on the table
(called couch) that slowly slides through the
gantry, which is the circular part of the CT
machine. Through the gantry, beams of x-rays are
aimed at the body. The source and detectors,
mounted on the ring, are rotated around the
patient to give views from a variety of direction.
This generates 2-D cross-sectional images called
tomographic images. The couch and patient are
then moved along the axis of the machine and P

numbers of images are then combined by a

computer to give a merged detailed 3-D image of the organs under investigation.

A CT scan of brain is shown in the Fig. 25.7. Here the CT scanner first combine multiple X-ray
images of brain taken from different angles to obtain a 2-D image of the section. Repeating this
process along an axis and combining 2-D images of multiple sections, a 3-D image of brain is

Importance of CT Scan Over Normal X-ray Film

CT scan gives a more detailed view than normal X-ray film. A normal X-ray film gives only
limited information because it is like a shadow. Fine detail within the X-rays film may be
invisible especially if one organ lies in front of the region of the body being studied. To give

olves various methods to identify abnormal
cell growth or tumor presence. Some detection techniques
include: imaging tests (such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, PET
scans, and ultrasound help visualize tumors), biopsy, blood
tests, and physical examination. In physical examination
doctors check for abnormalities, such as lumps or changes in
skin.

Tumor detection is a complex process, and ongoing research
aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and effectiveness. In
future, Al-assisted imaging analysis and diagnostics would be
used for tumor detection!

The logic of shape, quantity, and order is the subject of mathematics. The use of mathematics
in everything we do. In other words, it's everywhere. In everything the mathematics can be
used on a daily basis; for examples: computers, software, hardware, art, money, engineering,
sports, and even ancient and modern architecture is built around it.

A fascinating subject, mathematics includes formulas, branches, equations, and mathematical
reasoning. Without realizing it, math’s significance in daily life can be seen in a variety of ways.
In daily duties, mathematics is essential, whether it is for gaming or computation. Whether we
enjoy mathematics or not, it is a necessary part of daily life. As a result, we ought to
acknowledge this situation and the importance of mathematics in day-to-day living.

26.1 ELEGANCE OF MATHEMATICS

Although mathematics is an extremely elegant field, understanding its elegance requires some
knowledge. The beauty of mathematics is a topic that mathematicians like discussing. The
synchronizations, patterns, and assemblies of numbers and forms, the traditional principles of
symmetry and balance format, make the showcase of the beauty of mathematics.

The elegance of mathematics lies in how well everything fits together, unfortunately, the great
majority of people who are frightened by a fear of difficulties with numbers sometimes fail to
see its beauty. This is fixed by Mathematical Elegance. The author gives an interesting and
approachable picture of the mathematical world through the use of hundreds of examples.

The natural sciences, engineering, health, economics, computer science, and social sciences
all depend on mathematics. The fundamentals of mathematics are unaffected by scientific
experimentation, despite the fact that they are often utilized to model a phenomenon. Logical
reasoning and mental consistency are encouraged by mathematics, which also offers an
efficient method of developing mental discipline.

Furthermore, a comprehension of mathematics is essential for understanding the material
covered in other academic courses, including natural science, social studies, music, and even
the arts. For the purpose of conveying relationships of any kind quantitatively, mathematics is
a highly brief language.

Through the years, poets and authors have explored, with sometimes surprising, the link
between the expressive richness of natural language and the thoroughness of mathematics.

Artists have used mathematics to create bold analogies and set tight parameters within which
they can express their creativity. For example; Jorge Luis Borges, who is inspired by
mathematical reasons in several of his works, like the “An Aleph is a point in space that
encompasses all other points, offering a unified perspective where every location on Earth can
be seen simultaneously from all angles, without spatial confusion or limitation”.

The Magic of Mathematics

cna ia ai
The majority of people may associate mathematics with intricate equations, chalkboards
cavered with numbers, and sometimes even recollections of past tests. Mathematics is a
universal language that bridges the vast scales of the universe, describing the intricate patterns
of a seashell and the majestic spirals of distant galaxies with equal precision and beauty.

National Book Foundation @:2) 26-Nature of Science |

Mathematics is the thread that connects everything in the universe, trom the fascinating
patterns of the Fibonacci sequence seen in sunflowers and pinecones to the basic ideas
underlying the technological advancements we use on a daily basis.

Numbers are not the only thing in mathematics. It is the fundamental component of invention
as well as the language of the cosmos and the beat of nature. You are experiencing the amazing
magic of mathematics every time you are surprised by the design of a building, listen to a
beautiful melody, or just esteem the symmetry of a snowfall.

Mathematicians behave like Poet; who conveys a wide spectrum of human experiences and
emotions with the help of flowers’ delicate petals, brilliant colours, and perfumed tracks.
Similarly universal equation is very much similar to flower where different parameters, numbers
play role like petals, colour and even perfume to design equation, for example:

The Euler’s Equation;
e™+1=0

Euler’s identity shows that geometry, calculus, and complex numbers are intimately related.
Everybody knows the value of m, which represents the ratio of a circle's diameter to its
circumference. Scholars have researched this universal mathematical constant for millennia. It
is fundamental to geometry and can be found everywhere. Another number that is at least as
significant as m is e, which is approximately 2.718281. It is used to describe how something can
increase or decrease in proportion to itself, which is a fundamental idea in calculus, and it
plays a special role in the definition of exponentiation. Indeed, ‘e’ holds the same significance
in calculus as 1 does in geometry.

Finally, there is ‘i’, the hypothetical unit. In contrast to ‘e’ and ‘n’, ‘i’ is not a number. It is
absent from the standard number line. It is essentially a fictitious number: Although it was long
since established that negative numbers had no square roots, someone questioned whether or
not this would still hold true in practice. It turns out that complex numbers—numbers with both
real and imaginary components—are produced when square roots of -1 are allowed. i, which is
the positive square root of -1, is the fundamental unit of analysis in sophisticated mathematics.

Indeed, ‘e’ holds the same significance in calculus as nm does in geometry. t, e, i. the three
integers that matter most in mathematics. They all appear to be quite unique, don't they?
Throughout thousands of years of mathematical history, various individuals have studied them,
they are all abstract, and they appear to have no clear connection to one another. They are
also derived from quite distinct areas of mathematics. Complex numbers, geometry, and
calculus are closely connected, as demonstrated by Euler's identity. After all, they may be
explained in terms of one another, therefore they are not really. distinct domains. Complex
numbers can be thought of as the link between circular motion and arithmetic: The arithmetic
of complex numbers provides information on angles, rotations, cycles, and periods, whereas
the arithmetic of real numbers informs us about quantities.

Symmetry

In mathematics, symmetry is the balance and proportion that an object or geometric figure
displays when one half reflects the other. It happens when specific points, lines, or forms

perfectly match one another along a given axis. Group theory is an important area of algebra
with applications in computer graphics, chemistry, and crystallography. The study of symmetry
is essential to comprehend group theory.

People typically associate symmetry with reflecting a picture over a single plane to reveal the
exact identical image, much like when they took in a mirror. However, that is merely one kind
of symmetry. There are lots of alternative options. Rotational symmetry, for example, explains
that an object's attributes remain unchanged as it is rotated around an axis, such as the Earth's
orbit.

_ The word symmetry can be studied in the following four different phases;

tii) Rotational Symmetry iv) Point Symmetry

Applications of Symmetry

Not only does symmetry exist in abstract mathematical ideas, but it also infuses everyday life
and effects on many aspects of human existence.

Architecture: Structurally sound and aesthetically pleasing buildings are the result of
architects using symmetry.

Art and Design: Artists frequently utilize symmetry in their works of art to attain harmony
and balance.

Nature: The radial symmetry of starfish and the hexagonal symmetry of honeycombs are only
two examples of the many examples of symmetrical wonders found in nature.

Music: Symmetry is a tool used by composers of melodies and harmonies to arouse feelings and
produce enjoyable aural experiences.

The worid in which we live is three-dimensional. While there are many advantages to this,
according to Ivan Loseu, a mathematics associate professor at Northeastern University; it also
makes for a challenging math problem. He claimed that minimizing the number of variables at
play is the best route to a’solution. imagine that the Earth is rotating around the sun. Given
that the motion takes place in three dimensions, the Earth's position can only be described by
three variables. Given that the Earth never deviates from a specific plane, Newtonian physics
allows. us to further decrease the number of variables to only two. One variable is actually
preferable to two, though. This is the reason why physicists track the Earth's elliptical journey
using the characteristics of gravitational force.

According to Loseu,

The formula for gravity depends Sry on the distance between the sun and Earth. You can
change the image, but the physical law doesn't change.

He said that symmetry isthe single most important factor explaining why this problem can be
resolved with just one variable.

According to Loseu, symmetry is any transformation that keeps your issue intact.

What Scientists say about Mathematics?

Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas.

(Albert Einstein, German theoretical physicist)
We will always have STEM with us. Some things will drop out of the public eye and go away,
but there will always be science, engineering, and technology. And there will always, always
be mathematics.

(Katherine Johnson, African-American mathematician)
Mathematics as an expression of the human mind reflects the active will, the contemplative
reason, and the desire for aesthetic perfection. Its basic elements are logic and intuition,
analysis and construction, generality and individuality.

26.2 ARE ALIENS REAL?

The prospect of life beyond Earth has long fascinated human curiosity. Since man discovered
that Mars and other surrounding planets were distinct from other points of light in the night
sky, people have speculated about the possibility of otherworldly life. The question of whether
we are alone in the universe remains unanswered even though modern technology has made it
possible for us to investigate those worlds up close and even look at (and hear from) planets
orbiting other stars.

A very interesting comment on existences of aliens or aloneness of Earth;

Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally
terrifying.

(Arthur C. Clarke, science fiction author and former Planetary Society board member)

Many people have an alien belief; however, this idea is mostly based on movies and reports of
UFOs (unidentified flying objects). However, science sheds light on the possibility that we are
not alone in the universe and can address some of the most pressing concerns regarding the
nature of life that is most likely to exist.

Where might aliens exist?
There's a chance that life from beyond the solar system exists.

The comprehensive Mars exploration program of NASA (National Aeronautics and Space
Administration) and other space organizations have taught us that the red planet was once a
warm, wet planet that may have supported life. Even though scientists haven't discovered any
evidence of it yet, tiny life might yet be present there. Given that, several of Jupiter's and
Saturn's moons have liquid water beneath their ice crusts, there is a chance that these bodies
could support otherworldly life. Certain frozen worlds in the outer solar system, such as Europa
on Jupiter and Enceladus on Saturn, appear to have potentially functional underground waters.
And that’s the only thing found in our solar system. The number of divergent settings that
potentially support life is increasing as scientists discover additional exoplanets around other
stars and that is the thinking domain of future research for space seeker. According to Carl
Sagan (American astronomer) point of view;

There is a lot of space in the universe. If we're alone, it feels like a terrible use of space. So,
NASA will continue its search.

26.3 THOUGHT EXPERIMENT: NEWTON'S CANNONBALL

It was common knowledge that objects had a tendency to fall to the ground, but no one was
sure why. Yes, the term “gravitas,” which simply means “having weight” or gravity, was applied
to this unexplained effect. It was Newton who explained gravity, not who discovered it. Newton
provided a clear mathematical law that could be tested to explain all of these occurrences and
tie them together in a straightforward manner. The apple and the Moon are both connected to
the Earth by gravity. The Moon moves sideways, which accounts for their different motion and
the reason it doesn't land on Earth.

There were following two curiosity points of Newton’s research domain;

1. Why doesn't the Moon fall from the sky and land
on Earth, given that all objects experience
gravitational acceteration towards Earth?

2. Why.does the Moon move in a circle instead of
a straight line, if, as Galileo said, objects move
with constant speed and direction until acted
upon by an external force?

Newton understood; due to the combination of its
orbital motion and inertia, the Moon does not fall
perfectly to Earth, nor does it fly away due to the
acceleration Earthward that it experiences.

Newton devised a designed experiment in which
cannon was positioned on a towering mountain and
shot horizontally, as shown in Fig. 26.5. He was Figure 26.5: Newton’s Orbital Cannon.
aware that the cannonball's horizontally travel

distance in a time interval (t) could be calculated by multiplying its speed (v) by the interval
like; horizontal distance covered by cannon ball can be measured as;

X=vt

--- PAGE 219 ---
a a CS ee? 2. ee 7 . a” stn «sf ao Se ee

While the vertical distance covered by cannon can be measured as;
1
Y= —gt?
» 8

Newton therefore understood that, if he selected the ideal velocity, the cannonball’s trajectory
would curve at precisely the same rate as the Earth's, as the Earth is spherical, and the
projectile would always remain at the same height above the earth.

By doing this, he strikes a balance between the cannonball’s inertia, which causes it to desire
to keep going in a straight path and away from the Earth, and the acceleration brought on by
the Earth's gravity, which causes the cannonball to move towards the Earth's centre. As a result,
the projectile orbits the planet, never getting any closer to it yet constantly increasing in speed,
though acceleration is the change in velocity i.e., the change in both the speed and direction
of an object. The projectile in this instance accelerates even if its speed is constant since its
direction is changing. Newton discovered that the acceleration caused by Earth's gravity (a) and
the orbit's radius (r), which is measured from the orbit's centre (i.e., the Earth's centre), were
connected to the cannonball's speed in the following ways:

Centripetal acceleration = a = v*/r

Newton discovered it for a cannonball orbiting the Earth, but it holds true for any circularly
moving object as well. Because of inertia, objects always prefer to move in straight lines; some
sort of acceleration is required to cause them to bend into circular motion. The acceleration
for Newton's cannonball came from the Earth.

Results
Newton found the following results:

1) If velocity of cannon ball is less than the orbital velocity ball will fall on the Earth.
Horizontal distance = vt Too slow

Figure 26.6: Velocity of cannon ball is less than the orbital velocity ball.

2) If velocity of cannon ball is equal to the orbital velocity ball will stay in orbit.
