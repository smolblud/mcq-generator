Preface

This Model Textbook for Mathematics Grade 11 has been developed by NBF according to
the National Curriculum of Pakistan 2022-2023. The aim of this textbook is to enhance
learning abilities through inculcation of logical thinking in learners, and to develop higher
order thinking processes by systematically building the foundation of learning from the
previous grades. A key emphasis of the present textbook is creating real life linkage of the
concepts and methods introduced. This approach was devised with the intent of enabling
students to solve daily life problems as they grow up in the learning curve and also to fully
grasp the conceptual basis that will be built in subsequent grades.

After amalgamation of the efforts of experts and experienced authors, this book was
reviewed and finalized after extensive reviews by professional educationists. Efforts were
made to make the contents student friendly and to develop the concepts in interesting ways.

The National Book Foundation is always striving for improvement in the quality of its
textbooks. The present textbook features an improved design, better illustration and
interesting activities relating to real life to make it attractive for young learners. However,
there is always room for improvement, the suggestions and feedback of students, teachers

and the community are most welcome for further enriching the subsequent editions of this
textbook. .

May Allah guide and help us (Ameen).

COMPLEX NUMBERS

After studying this unit, students will be able to:

¢ Recall complex number z represented by an expression of the form z = a + ib or of the form
(a,b) where a and b are real numbers and i = V—1
Recognize @as a real part of z and b as an imaginary part of z.

Know the condition for equality of complex numbers.

Carry out basic operations on complex numbers
Define z = a — ib a as the complex conjugate of z = a + ib.
Define z = Va? + b2 as the absolute value or modulus of a complex number z = a + ib.
Solve the simultaneous linear equations with complex coefficients. For example,

5z-—(3+iw=7-i
te ome a caeus —1+i
e Write the polynomial P(z) as a product of linear factors. For example,
z? +a? = (z—ia)(z+ia) and, z?—3z?7+z+5 =(z+1)(2-2-(2-2+i)

¢ Solve quadratic equation of the form pz? + qz + r = 0 by completing squares where p, q,r are
real numbers and z is a complex number. For example solve

z*-2274+5=0= (z-1-2i)(2-1+2i) =0 =>2z=1+2i,1-2i

Explain the polar coordinates system
- Describe the polar representation of a complex number,
Apply the operations with complex numbers in polar representation
Demonstrate simple equations and in-equations involving complex numbers in polar form
Apply concepts of complex numbers to real world problems (such as cryptography, wave
phenomena, calculate voltage, current, circuits, the velocity and pressure of the fluid).

| Complex numbers are used in many branches of science; especially quantum mechanics (a
branch of Physics) heavily depends upon complex numbers.

In mathematics the need of complex numbers is to solve the polynomials which do not have the
solution in the set of real numbers. e.g., The polynomial x? — 1 = 0 has the solutions x = +1,
which are the real numbers. But the polynomial x? + 1 = 0 do not have any solution in the set of
real numbers, since there is no real number, whose square is —1. To overcome this difficulty, we
extended the set of real numbers to the set of complex numbers by introducing a number i such

that i? = —1 or i = Y—1 . Remember that i? = —1 is the Euler’s notation for the imaginary unit
| number.

1.1 Complex Number “

A complex number is an expression of the form x + iy where x,y € R. A complex number is
denoted by z, i.e., z = x + iy and the set of all complex numbers is denoted by C .The complex
number x + iy is also denoted by the ordered pair (x, y).The reason for this notation is justified
since there is one to one corresponding between x + ty and (x, y).

Clearly i = 0 + i = (0,1) and 1 = 1+ 0i = (1,0)

1.1.1 Real and Imaginary Parts of a Complex Number

Every complex numberz=x-+ iy has two parts x and y. x is called the real part and yis called
the imaginary part i.e., Re(z) = x and Jm(z) = y.

If the real part of a complex number is zero then it is called pure imnaginary number and if the
imaginary part of the complex number is zero then it is called real number.

Since every real number x can be written as x + i0 thus every real number is a complex number
but note that every complex number need not be a real number. Only the complex numbers with
zero imaginary part are real numbers. Thus, the set of real number is a subset of set of complex
numbers, i.e., Rc C.

Example 1:

Let z = 2 + 3i where z isa igi number having 2 as real part and 3 as the i imaginary part.

1.1.2 Condition for the Equality of Two Complex Numbers

Like real numbers any two complex numbers are not comparable. i.e., We cannot say that one
complex number is greater than or less than the other complex number. Two complex numbers are
said to be equal if both has same real and imaginary parts.

Example 2:
Let z, = x, + iy, and Zz, = x2 + iy2 be two complex numbers they will be equal i.e.; z, = Z2 if
and only if x; = x2 and y; = y2
1.2 Basic Algebraic Operations on Complex Numbers

1.2.1 Addition of Two Complex Numbers |
Suppose we have two complex numbers Zz; = X; + iy; = (x, Yi) and zz =X2 + ty2 = (x2, Ya).

Then theirsumis: —
| 2422 = (%V)t+G2z72) = atin tx2+2

= (xy + x2) +iQit+y2) = Ca txn Vi +2)
Example 3: Find the sum of z, = 2 + 3i and z, = 6 + 8i.
Solution:
Z, +22 = (2 +3i) + (6+ 8i) = (2+ 6) + (3+ 8)i
= 8+ 11i = (8,11)

1.2.2. Subtraction of Two Complex Numbers
Suppose’ we have two complex numbers 2, = x, + iy, = (x,, y,) and 2, = X, + iy, =(x,, 2).
The difference of the two complex numbers is given by:

--- PAGE 7 ---
Z,-22 = (%¥)—-G2y2) 8=9= Ga tin)— (x2 + iy2)
= (xy — x2) +101 -—Y2) = Gi -—%n Mi - y2)
Example 4: Ifz, = 4—3iand z, = 7 + 6é, then find z, — 22.
Solution: .
21-2, = (4—3i) — (7 + 6i) = (4-7) + (—3 — 6)i
= -3 + (-—9i) = —3 -9i
1.2.3. Product of Two Complex Numbers
If z, = x, + iy, = (%,y) and 22 = x2 t+ iy2 = (x2, ¥2) are any two complex numbers, then
their product is given as:
ZZ = (X,Y) (Xa V2) = (%1 + 11) 2 + iy2)
: = XX + ixyy2 + ixayy t PV. = X1X2 + U2 + X21) — 12
: = (X4X_ — VrV2) + UxrV2 +X2V1) = (%1X2 — Var %1V2 + X2Vr)
Example 5: Find the product of the complex numbers Z; = (2, —6) and zz = (4,9)
Solution:
2122 = (2,-6)(4,9) = (2 — 61) (4 + 91)

=8+ 18i-—24i1—54i? = 8 — 6i — (—54)
=8 +54 —6i = 62 — 6i = (62,—6)
1.2.4 Division of Complex Numbers
The division of the two complex numbers is not simple. Since the number in the denominator has
two independent parts. To make the denominator a single term we rationalize (multiply and
divide) the given complex number by the conjugate of the denominator. After rationalization the
denominator will be converted into a single real number and thus division can be done easily.

1.3 Conjugate of a Complex Number

Conjugate of a complex number z = x + iy is denoted by
Z and is defined as Z = x — iy.

- Geometrically, conjugate of a complex number is its mirror
image about x-axis, For example, if z = 3 + 4i then Z = 3 — 4i.

Example 9: Find the conjugate of z = (1 + i)(2 — i). Key Facts
Solution: 7% =o

1.4 Magnitude or Modulus of a Complex Number

Consider the complex number z = x + iy = (x,y) its magnitude is denoted by |z| and
find it as follows

Draw a complex number z = x + iy = (x,y) on the complex plane.
Draw perpendicular from P on the real axis.
It is clear that PAO is a right-angled triangle.
So, by using Pythagoras theorem; we have
[OP|" = [oa|" + [AP
= |z)? =x? +y?
=> |z| = /x? +?
which is the magnitude of the complex number z.
Also, |z| = (Re(z))* + (Im(z))*
Obviously |z| is the distance of z = (x, y) from origin.

Theorem:
If z is acomplex number then |z| = 0 and |z| = 0 iffz = 0.

Proof: Let z = x + iy; then |z| = /x? + y?, where x and y are real. Since the square of any real
number is always non-negative. Thus, value of x? + y is non-negative, also square-root of the
non-negative number is non-negative. Hence 7 x? + y? is non-negative; i.e.; |z| = 0.

Now suppose that |z| = 0 —- — Key Facts
order to calculate conjugate

Which is possible only ifx = 0 and y = 0 simplify it first then take

Thus z= x+iy=0+i0=0 conjugate or we take first
Conversely, suppose that z = 0 = 0 + i0 conjugate than simplify the

1.6 Solution of Equations

When we consider more than one equation then it is called system of equations and if we find the
values of variables which satisfies all the equations under considerations simultaneously, is
called the simultaneous solutions of the equations.

If z and w are the two complex variables then an equation of the form az + bw = p is called
equation with complex variables z and w. Here a and b cannot be zero at the same time. If a and
b belong to the set of complex numbers (i.e.; they are itself complex numbers) then the equation
is called linear equation in two variables with complex coefficients.

Here we will find the solution of system of two simultaneous equations in two variables with

complex coefficients.
e A system of equations is
1.6.1 Working Rule to Find the Solution by consistent if it has at least one
Elimination Method solution.
Consider the two linear equations: ¢ A system of equations which has s

no solution is called inconsistent.

a,z + byw = p; and azz + b,w = pp
Step 1: Multiply the equation or both equations by suitable numbers so that the
coefficients of one of the variables become same.
Step 2: By adding or subtracting the equations thus obtained in Step 1, eliminate the term
involving the variable having same coefficients.

Step 3: The equation obtained in Step 2 will have only one variable. From here find the
value of this variable.

Step 4: Substitute the value of the variable found in Step 3 in any one of the given
equations and get the value of the other variable.
Step 5: Writing the values of z and w in the form of ordered pair (z, w) is the notation of
the system of equations. .
1.6.2 Working Rule to Find the Solution by Substitution Method
Step 1: Find the value of any one of the variables in terms of the other variable from any
one of the equations given above.

Step 2: Substitute the value of the variable obtained in Step 1 to the equation which is not
used yet.

Step 3: Equation obtained i in the Step 2 will involve only one variable. Find its value.

Step 4: Substitute the value of variable obtained in Step 3 in any one the given equations
and get the value of the other variable.

Step 5: Writing the values of the both unknowns z and w in the ordered pair (z, w) is the
solution of the system.

Example 15: Solve the following system of simultaneous equations:

2z-(1-3)w=1+2i, (1+0)z+(2-D)w=2+i

Solution:
2z—(1 - 3i)@ = 1+2i (1)

1.7 Complex Polynomial
If z is a complex variable, then the expression @y + az + Q2z* + +++ a,2" is called complex
polynomial of degree n if a, # 0 and n is a non-negative integer. Here Go, @,, 42, ..., Ay are "
constants and may be real or complex. Let us denote this polynomial by P(z) i.e.;
P(z) = dg + ayz + apz7 + + ayz"
When n = 1; then the polynomial is ag + az and is called linear polynomial. We are interested
to factorize the polynomial of the two types as a product of linear factors.
(i)  P(z) =z* + a?; where a is a real number.
(ii)  P(z) = az? + bz? + cz +d; where a,b, c,d are all real numbers.

1.7.1 Factorization of Polynomial of the Type z* + a’ as a Polynomial of Linear Factor
The factorization of this type of polynomials is simple . Consider
z? +a? =z? —i?a? = z? — (ia)* = (z + ia)(z — ia)
(z+ ia)(z — ia) are required linear factors of z* + a”.

1.7.2. Factorization of Polynomial of the Type az* + bz? + cz + d = 0 where a + O

To factorize this type of polynomial first we find one of its factors with the help of factor
theorem and then do the synthetic division to find the depressed equation.
Recall that z — a is a factor of the polynomial P(z) iff P(a) = 0. We may say that a is a root or
zero of the polynomial.
¢.g.; Z — 2 is a factor (root or zero) of the polynomial P(z) = 22° + 3z* + 62 — 40; since
P(2) = 2(2)3 + 3(2)? + 6(2) —40 = 0.
Example 16: Factorize the polynomial P(z) = z* + 2z? — Sz — 6.
Solution: Product of coefficient of z*and the last term is (1)(6) = 6. ‘
The possible roots of the equation are the factors of 6 which are +1, +2, +3, +6.
Since = p(_4) = (—1)? + 2(-1)? - 5(-1) - 6 = 0.
So z — (—1) = z+ 1 isa factor of the polynomial. To factorize it completely use the method of

synthetic division.

= (z+ 1)(z + 3)(z — 2)

Example 17: Solve the equation 2z? — 6z — 9 = 0 by completing square method.

1.8 Polar Coordinate System

Another way to locate a point in the plane is polar coordinate system consists of a fixed-point O
called the pole and the horizontal line emerging from the pole is called initial line (polar axis).
For a point P in the plane if r is its distance from the pole and @ is

the angle which is measured anticlockwise from the initial line to

the line OP then the ordered pair (r, @) are the polar coordinates

of the point P. P(r, 2)
The angle @ is also called the arg(z). -
e Forz= 0 the arg(z) is undefined so it is under stood
that z + 0 whenever we use polar coordinate system. "6 \
e Ifacomplex number z = x + iy has polar coordinates O Initial line

(r, @) then its conjugate is 7 = x — iy has polar coordinates (r, —0).

1.9 Complex Numbers in Polar Form

form. Draw it on the complex plane as shown in the
figure.

Let r = |z|, and @ be the angle in positive

direction

which OP makes with the initial line(x-axis).

Draw a perpendicular from P on the initial line

This form of the complex number is called polar form of a complex number.
1.9.2. Principal Argument
The symbol arg(z) actually represents a set of values, but the argument @ of a complex number
that lies in the interval —z < @< zis called the principal value of arg(z) or the principal
argument of z. The principal argument of z is unique and is represented by the symbol Arg(z),
that is, —-7 < Arg(z) < 1.

If 6 is the principal argument then principal values can be calculated

As in first quadrant value is 8, in second quadrant value is 1 — 9,

E In fourth quadrant value is —6 then in third quadrant is 8 — Tt.
. Example 18:
Find the modulus and principal argument of the following complex numbe

1.10 Application of Complex Numbers in Real World

Complex numbers are used in many real-life situations such as cryptography, wave phenomena,
pressure and velocity of the fluid and for the calculation of voltage and current in the circuits. These
applications are of higher level so will be discussed in higher classes. Here we are going to use the
complex numbers by giving an easy example of the simple harmonic motion. In simple harmonic
motion we have to determine the position of the microscopic particle from its mean position. The
equation which gives the position of the particle from mean position is ‘

Where x is the displacement of the particle from mean position, Xmax is the amplitude and

e'® = cos 6 + isin@ is the complex number. It is also called Eular’s equation.

:
Example 25: A micro particle is performing to and fro motion. Find its position at an angle of - ‘
when its amplitude is 0.05mm.
Solution:

We are given Xmax = 0.05 '
a
and @= z
Using the formula
X = Xn?
= i =
x = 0.05e'7 = 0.05 (cos + isin 5)
x = 0.05(0 + i) = 0.05i
It means particle is at the position where we cannot see it but just think about it.

The above formula can also be written as x = Xmaxe'”® where wis the angular velocity and t is ‘
the time. Also w = 27 where fis the frequency of the particle.
Electrical Engineering: ; d

The flow of electricity /, in a circuit, the resistance to flow Z, called impedance and

the electromotive force £, called voltage is given by the formula E = /.Z, Electrical engineers
use / to represent the imaginary units. But for understanding we are representing the imaginary
part with i. :

Example 26:An electrical engineer is designing a circuit that is to have a current of (6 — 8i) amps.
If impedance is (14 + 8i), find the voltage.

Solution:
Here we have I = (6 — Bi) ‘
and impedance Z = (14 + Bi),

Using the formula E=1xZ

E=]xZ= (6 — 8i)(14 + 8i)
= 148 - 64i. a '

Use of complex numbers in the wave phenomenon

Example 27: Compute the potential difference across two AC power supplies with respect to
time. When V, = 3cos(t + 30°) and Vz, = 4sin(t + 120°).

Solution:

To find the total potential difference, simply adding V4 and Vp is not correct. so
we have to follow the method given below

Let Z, = 3{cos(t + 30°) + isin(t + 30°)}

and Z, = 4{cos(t + 120°) + isin(t + 120°)}

therefore, V, = Re(Z,) and Vp =-Re(Zp)

Note that Z, = 3e!(¢+3°" and Z, = 4e!(t+120")

, = Z, +Zp = Zeilt+30*) é 4ei{t+120°) re ef (3050% rm 4e 120°C)

Zeotar = e'*{3(cos30° + isin30°) + 4(cos120° + isin120°)}

r = /(0.5980762)7 + (1.964102)? =V25=5

Use of complex numbers in Resistor in AC circuit ©
Let us consider a simple AC circuit with a resistor as shown below. Let v(t) be an AC voltage source
given by v(t) = V, cos(wt) = Re(V,e'*)

R | V(t)e

Where V, and w are real quantities
The relation between the current i through and
voltage v(t) across the resistor R is given by v(t), = Ri
Using the single loop shown above we have v(t) = v(t),
v(t) is given by v(t) = V, cos(wt) (
Hence v(t), = V, cos(wt) = Re(V,e'*)
Combining the above we write Ri= Re(V,e*) _ ....(i)
Let Vz = V,e"* and rewrite (i) above as Ri = ReVy
Since R is areal quantity, the above may be written as i= Re (*)
Let Zz be defined as the impedance of a resistor such that Zp = R
Since R is real, the impedance Z, of a resistor is a real number
Current i then may be written as i= me (2)
Let) = 3*
The above gives a relationship similar to Oham’s law in DC (Direct Current) circuits. The above

relationship between complex quantities /, Vz and R makes calculations much easier.

This simplifies calculations in the sense that we do calculations using complex impedance, voltage and
current and then take the real part as the final answer.

MATRICES AND DETERMINANTS

After studying i..i. unit, students will be able to:

Apply matrices operations (addition/subtraction and multiplication of matrices) with real and
complex CHtypes,

Evaluate v¢‘erminants of 3 x 3 matrices by using co-factors and properties of determinants.
Use row operations to find the inverse and rank of a matrix.

Explain a consistent and inconsistent system of linear equations and demonstrate through
examples.

Solve «asystemof 3 by 3 non-homogencous linear equations by using matrix inversion method
and Cramer's cule

Solve a system of three homogeneous linear equations in three unknowns using Gaussian
elimination method.

Apply concepts of matrices to real world problems such as (graphic design, data encryption,
sctsmic analysis, cryptography, transformation of geometric shapes, social network analysis).

A very common use of matrices in daily life is
encryption. We use:them to scramble data for security
purpose and to encode and decode this data. There is a
key that helps encode and decode data which is
generated by matrices. The screen of any electronic
device, like smart phone or LED TV screen is
essentially a pixel matrix. When we rotate the phone
and it is in landscape form; the matrix is actually rotated
using the transpose. When we touch the screen of a cell
phone at some specific position; the position is
calculated by matrix properties.

In mathematics we use matrices to solve the system
of linear equations. Matrices are also used frequently
almost in all sciences.

In 19" century the term matrix was introduced by English mathematician James Sylvester. Then after
taking the idea of matrices from Sylvester, Arthur Cayley developed the algebra of matrices and

published two papers in 1850s. On system of linear equations matrices was applied by Cayley's
where they are still useful.

| 2.1. Matrices

A matrix is an array of numbers arranged in horizontal and vertical lines enclosed within square
brackets. Matrices are usually denoted by capital letters.

| The horizontal lines are known as rows of the matrix and vertical lines

*

) are known as columns of the matrix.e.g.; 4 = ? : 2

Each number in the matrix is called’ an element or entry of the matrix. Every element in the
| matrix has definite position which can be specified by the number of rows first and then’ number
of column where it exists. In the above matrix position of element ‘8’ is determined where
second row and third column meet each other. In general, an element in the ith row and the jth
column is denoted by a,, and generally the matrix 4 is written as A = [a; jl

a

sit is 2]
Where | in first row and first column similar 4 is in first row and second column and so on.
2.1.1 Order of a Matrix
How many rows and columns are there in a matrix is known as order of the matrix. Ifa matrix A
has m number of rows and n number of columns then the order of the matrix is m x n or m-by-n,
We always write number of rows first then number of columns. |
If we multiply m by n; it gives us the total number of elements in the matrix. e.g.; if there are 2
rows and 3 columns in a matrix A then its order is 2 x 3; often we write A>2x3-. The product of 2
and 3 is 6; so, there are six elements in matrix A as given above.

2.3 Determinants

Every square matrix is associated with some number (real or complex). This number
is called the determinant of the matrix.

If A is any square matrix then its determinant is denoted by det(A) or |A].

To find the value of this determinant; we express the above determinant into the sum or
difference of determinants of order 2. This process of finding the value of the determinant is
called expansion of the determinant.

We can expand a determinant from any row or any column. Since in a determinant of order 3; there
are three rows namely R,, R,, R, and three columns C,, C, and C,, so we can expand the determinant
in six different ways; but the value of determinant will remain the same in,each case.
If we expand the above given determinant from 1" row i.c., from R1 then:
422 Az3 o at Tl Fs @21 |
@32  @33 M2 1a31 a3 *31d31 G32
= 411 (422433 — @23452) — ay2 (421433 — 2303;) + @13(421432 — 22431)
This can be generalized for determinants of the square matrices of higher order,
2.3.3 Minor of an Element of a Square Matrix
Let we have any square matrix A of order 7, i.e; A = Leis) en’ then the minor of the element
aj; of matrix is a determinant of the matrix of order (n — 1) x (n— 1) obtained by neglecting
the ith row and jth column of the matrix A. Minor of a;; is denoted by M;;. For example;
consider a matrix A of order 3 x 3.
411 42 43
A= es 22 as
431 432 433 Qy2 43) . ,
The minor of the element az, is Mz, where M2), = A a3,| #8 the determinant obtained by

The associated determinant is |A| =

JA] = ay,

neglecting 2" row and 1* column of the matrix A. Likewise we can find all the minors of
elements of the matrix A.
2.3.4 Cofactor of an Element of a Square Matrix

For any square matrix A of order n x n, the cofactor of an clement a;; of matrix A is denoted by
Ai and is defined as Ay, = (—1)"*JM,,_ e.g., If

@11 442 443
A= ex 22 a
431 G32 433
Then cofactor of the element a3; is:

Qy2 a :
Az, = (—1)***M2, = (—1)° | : = = (—1) (12433 — 443432) = —a,2033 + 413032

G32 G33

Example 10: IfA = 1 2 6 then find M,2, M23 and A, and A>;.

Solution: Mis = l= A = (—1)(—4) — (3)(6) = 4-18 = -14

Ms =| 9| = (1000) - (3)(3) = 0-9 = -9

Ai2 = (—1)?*2M,, = (-—1)3(-—14) = (—1)(—14) = 14

From the above discussion it is clear that, |A] can be evaluated by adding the product of elements
with corresponding cofactors of any row or column of the matrix.

1 2p,
Example 11: IfA= | Go 4 2 then find |A| using cofactors.
Solution: “1 3 0

First, we find cofactors of any one of the row or column of the given matrix. Let us find the

cofactors of C;. The elements of C3 are a;3,@23 and @33. In this case @,3 = 6,a23 = 2 and
@33 = 0. Now we find their corresponding cofactors,

As = (-1)'8| 9 3] = (a8 -(-1)) = 14) =1
Aaa = (-1)*43| 3] = (-1)9(3> (+2) = (16) = -

As = (-1)*3[5 4] = (-1)8(1 - 0). SQ) = 1
* |Al = ay3Ay3 + @23A23 + a33A33
= 6(1) + 2(—5) + 0(11) = 6 -10+0= -4
2.3.6 Singular and Non-Singular Matrices
Any square matrix A is called singular if |A| = 0.
If |A] * 0 then it is called non-singular matrix.
1 ¥ 4g
For example, for the matrices A = li 4 and B = 1 2 |:
[A] = Hi aI = (1)(2) — (3)(4) = 2-12 =-10 *0

12
[B| = |1

= (3)(2) — 12(5) = 660

Thus A is non-singular matrix and B is singular matrix.
2.3.4 Adjoint of a Square Matrix

Consider any Square matrix A of order n:

--- PAGE 44 ---
A=|: emt then the adjoint of A is written as adj(A) and is the matrix

If the order of the matrix A is 3 X 3. i.e.

A= |@21 G22  @23|thenadj(A)=|A;2 Az2 Asz2

2.3.7 Multiplicative Inverse of a Square Matrix

Two square matrices of same order n are said to be the multiplicative inverses of each other if
their product is /,(identity matrix of order n).
Only non-singular matrices have their multiplicative inverses.
If A is a non-singular matrix then its multiplicative inverse is denoted by A~* and
AA =A™*A=I1
2.3.8 Adjoint Method to Find the Inverse of a Non-Singular Matrix
If A is a non-singular square matrix i.e.; |A| # 0 then A~* = ai adj(A)

Obviously if A is a singular then |A| = 0, then A~* = wai (A) will not exist.

ze 8
Example 12: IfA = o 3 1 then find A~? by adjoint method.

Solution: e A? =< Reciprocal of a

Since |A| = “ : ; matrix is not defined
21 4 e Ifthe inverse of matrix A ‘

= 2(12 —2) —-1(0 —4) + 0(0—6) = 20+ 4+0=24+0 <
Thus, A is non-singular. To find the adjoint of A we find cofactors of all the elements of A.
Ay, = (-—1)*** 5 ‘| = (—1)?(12 — 2) = (1)(10) = 10 4

2.5.5 Using Row Operation to Find the Inverse of a Non-Singular Matrix |

Row operations can be performed on a non-singular matrix A to find its inverse. For this consider
an identity matrix / of same order as that of A. Write A and / parallel to each other. Now

perform same row operations on A and J so that matrix A reduce to /, consequently the matrix /
will also reduce to some new matrix which is the inverse of A.

Note: We can also perform one ——'t to find A“,

Example 29: Find A~*,ifA =|4 3 1] by using row operations.

2.6 Solving System of Linear Equations
Liner Equation
An equation of the form a,x, + @2x2 = k,; where @,,a@2 and k, are constants and at least one
of a; and azis non-zero is called a linear equation in two variables x, and xp.
Similarly, the equation of the form a,x, + @2X2z + @3X3 = k2; where a,,@2,a, and k; are
constants and at least one of a,, a2 and a3 is non-zero is called a linear equation in three variables
X1,Xz and x3. In the same manner we can extend this for n number of variables.
System of Linear Equations
When we deal with more than one linear equation at the same time; then it is called system of
linear equations. We divide the system of linear equations into two categories:
(i) Homogeneous system of linear equations.
(ii) | Non-homogeneous system of linear equations.

2.6.1 Homogeneous and Non-homogeneous Linear Equations
Homogeneous System of Linear Equations
Consider the following system of linear equations

ax+ byy+oz =k,

Q2x + boy + C2z = ky

a3X + b3y + C3z = ky
If k, = kz = k3 = 0; then the system is called homogeneous system of linear equations.

4x + byy+cz = 0

Q2x + boy + coz =.0

3x + bsy +¢3z= 0

Non- Homogeneous System of Linear Equations
For the following system of linear equations
a,x + byy + yz = ky
a2x + boy + Coz = kz
a,x + b3y +¢3z = kg
If at least one of k,, kz and kg is non-zero then the system is called non-homogeneous system of
equations.
2.6.2 Solution of System of Linear Equations
The values of the variables involved in the system of linear equations which when substituted in
any equation of the system the equation is satisfied; is known as the solution of the system.
A system may have no solution or unique solution or infinite number of solutions.
Solution of Homogeneous System of Linear Equations
Consider a system of homogeneous equations
ax+by+c,z2=0
a,x+b.y+¢,2=0
a;x + bsy +¢3z = 0

--- PAGE 61 ---
Ee Sele

a bh XY x
a3 b; C3 Zz 0

So, we write AX = O .

) Observe that each equation of the system is satisfied if we take x = 0; y = 0; z = 0. So, (0,0, 0)
is the solution of the homogeneous system of linear equations. Since this solution always exists
for all systems of the homogeneous equations thus it is called trivial solutions of the system. All
solutions other than trivial solution are known as non-trivial solutions of the system.

Observe that, if the coefficients matrix A is non-singular then A~*exists; so
- (1) = A™*(AX) = A~?(0) Condition for the eae of
= (A~1A)X =O : homogeneous liner equations to
~I1X=0O have non-trivial solution is that
=>X=0 |Aj =

x 0
-b-(
=>x=0,y=0,z=0

i,e.; : The system has a trivial solution.
The system of homogeneous linear equations may have non-trivial solution if |A| = 0

Example 30: How many solutions does the following system of homogencous linear
equations has?

This system has only trivial solution.
Example 31; Solve the homogeneous system of linear equations

Solution:
The coefficients matrix is:

[A] = iat 3h 1+2]5 a
|A] = 1(-1 + 12) — 3(2 — 3) + 2(-8 +1)
JA] = 11+3-14=0
So the system has non-trivial solution.
Multiplying equation (1) by 2 then subtracting equation (2) from it , we get:
(1) =>2x46y+4z=0
(2) x VS °

7y+z=0,5 (4)
Subtracting equation (3) from equation (1), we have:
(1) >x+3y+2z=0
(3) =x-4y+z=0
- + -
7y+z=0 (5)

Now equations (4) and (5) are identical
Put z = t in equation (4).
=7y+t=0 = 7y=-t>y=—it
Substituting these values in equation (1), we have:
x+3(-3t)+2¢=0
>x-lt+2t=0>x+4t=0

x -e

Thus (- > t, - =t, t) are the infinite many solutions. By assigning different values to t we will
have different solutions. i.e. infinitely many solution of teR

2.6.3 Consistent System of Equations

A system of linear equations which has at least one solution is called consistent system of
equations.

2.6.4 In-consistent System of Equations

A system of linear equations which has no solution at all is called in-consistent system of

inconsistent if Rank A # Rank A».
If Rank A = Rank A, = number of unknowns, then the system has a unique solution.
If Rank A = Rank A, < number of unknowns, then system has infinite many solutions.
2.6.7 Augmented Matrix

together with the constants on the right side of equations is called an augmented matrix. It is
usually denoted by A,. For the above system of linear equations the augmented matrix is:

The system may be writien in matrix form as AX = B.

2.7 Application of Matrices

Matrices are used in many disciplines. For example, in cryptography. We explain the process of
encryption and decryption by means of an example. se

Suppose that the sender and receiver consider messages in alphabets A toZ only, both assign the

numbers | to 26 to the letters A toZ respectively, and the number 0 to a blank space. For simplicity,
the sender employs a key as post-multiplication by a non-singular matrix of order 3 of his own

choice. The receiver uses post-multiplication by the inverse of the matrix which has been chosen

by the sender.

Let the encoding matrix be 1-1 1
A= ; —1 |
1 0 0

Like matrix inversion method; Cramer rule can be used only if A is non-singular.

Let the message to be sent by the sender be “WELCOM Ee".

Since the key is taken as the operation of post-multiplication by a square matrix of order 3, the
message is cut into pieces (WEL), (COM), (E), each of length 3, and converted into a sequence

of row matrices of numbers:
[23 5 12], [3 15 13], [5 00).

--- PAGE 69 ---
Note that, we have included two zeros in the last row matrix. The reason is to get a row
matrix with 5 as the first entry. ;
Next, we encode the message by post-multiplying each row matrix as given below:

Row matrix Matrix Matrix

1-1 1
2 -1 j [45 -28 23]
1 0
1-1 1

0
2 <1 j [46 -18° 3]
Te te

zs =2 ©
Oe a

So the encoded message is [45 .-28 -23][46 -18 3][5 -5 5]
The receiver will decode the message by the reverse key, post-multiplying by the inverse of A.

» Ti | j

So the decoding matrix is
AS =Ta 744 = o -1 4
The receiver decodes the coded message as follows:

Row matrix — Matrix _Row matrix .
0 0 11Zla
jo -1 2] }{23 5 42]
1 al

: i.8° 2

[46 -18 3] 0 -1 2
4 uf. 1
a .
0 -1 2 ‘
1 “a 4

So, the sequence of decoded row matrices is [23 5 12], [315 13], [500].

Thus, the receiver reads the message as “WELCOME”. ‘

Example 36: Write the transformation matrix and the transformed equation of the line

2x + y — 3 = 0 which is 1 unit above the given line. :

Solution: Let the transformed variables are x’ and y’ since y is to be shifted 1 unit above, so
y=y’-1=>y' =y+1 as there is no change in x, so x’ = x. Thus the matrix transformation is

Pe b=a=5 23

--- PAGE 70 ---
Pl=Cl+(4)

And the transformed equation is

2x’ + (y’-1)-3=0

2x’ + (y’- 1) -3 =0 => 2x'+(y’-1)-3=0

2x’ +y’-1-3=0
2x’'+y'-4=0

Vectors are utilised in day-to-day life to assist in the
localization of people, places, and things. They are
also used to describe things that are acting in response
to an external force being applied to them. A quantity
that possesses both a magnitude and a direction is
known as a vector. The first, second, and third laws of
Newton are all relationships between vectors that
precisely describe the motion of bodies when they are
subjected to the influence of an outside force.
Newton's laws cover a wide range of phenomena and
can be used to describe anything from a ball in free
fall to a rocket on its way to the moon.

3.1 Vectors

i. Sealar

A physical quantity which can be completely specified by its magnitude only is called a scalar.
e.g., mass, time, distance and volume etc.

ii. Vector

A physical quantity which is completely specified by its magnitude as well as direction. e.g.,
weight, displacement, velocity and acceleration etc.

B (head)
3.1.1 Geometrical Representation of a Vector ra
Geometrically a vector is represented by a line segment with an arrow

head at its one end. The length of the line segment describes the magnitude A (tail)

and the arrow head indicates the direction of the vector.

The end A is called the tail or the initial point of the vector and the end B is called the terminal

point. In the figure vector AB is shown. It is denoted by AB.

Usually, the vectors are denoted by bold face letters a,b and c etc.; or a, b, é. There are also
other notations to denote a vector like a,b and c etc.

In the figure vector OA is denoted by G. The magnitude or
(e)

the length or the norm of the vector OA denoted by |OA| or |4l.

ii. Equal Vectors

Two vectors G and b are said to be equal if both have the a

same magnitude and direction. .
It is not necessary for the equal vectors to have the same vA
position. If vectors @ and b are equal then we write @ = B.

Geometrically two vectors are equal if they are translation
of one another.

iii. Negative of a Vector
A vector having the same magnitude but opposite in direction of a J.
vector G@ is called the negative of @ and is denoted by —d. ~
iv. Zero or Null Vector

If the initial and terminal points of a vector coincide then the

vector has zero length. This vector is called zero vector and is denoted by O. The zero
vector has no direction. It can be assigned as convenient direction according to the situation.

v. Unit Vector

A vector which is in the direction of non-zero vector ad and has magnitude | is called unit vector

of @ and is denoted by @. If a is non-zero vector of arbitrary length |@| then

< a

This means any vector d@ can be obtained by multiplying the magnitide of the vector to its unit
vector. The process of finding the unit vector of a vector d, is called normalizing vector d.

vi. Parallel Vectors

Two non-zero vectors @ and b are said to be parallel if d@ = Ab; a

where A is a scalar. If value of A is positive then both vectors have Fj

the same direction and if value of A is negative then both are in the A
opposite direction. The vectors which are in the opposite direction are 5
known as antiparallel vectors.

vii. Position Vector

The vector used to specify the position of a point P with respect to

origin O is called position vector of P. The tail of this vector is at r

origin and tip at the point P. Thus OP is the position vector of point

P’with respect to O. O(x, y) ieide

3.1.3 Addition of Vectors
i. Head to Tail Rule or Triangle Law of Addition

fi >
To add non-zero vectors d and b, join the tail of the second vector a
with the head of the first vector. Now the vector obtained by joining

the tail of the first vector to head of the second vector is the vector b
a+b.

@ + B is known as resultant vector of a and b. ,

This method for the addition of two vectors is called Head to Tail

rule of addition. Since @, b and @ + B are along the sides of a triangle
ABC, so the rule of addition is also called triangle law of addition.
ii. Parallelogram Law of Addition

Consider any parallelogram ABCD. Let AB = Gand AD = B.
Since the vector BC has the same magnitude and direction as
that of AD; so BC = AD.Also DC has the same magnitude and

direction as that of AB so DC = AB.
Using triangle law of addition, we have

AB+BC =AC
ie:a@+b=AC

b

--- PAGE 76 ---
This mean diagonal vector AC of the parallelogram is the sum of

the vectors of @ and b.
This is known as parallelogram law of addition.

Example I: -

Let us consider two vectors that is d = 2t +3 - Sk and b =t— 5) + 2F Rapeceimenttg
head to tail rule

a+b =(20+37 —5k) + (?-5j+ 2k)

a+b = 21+ 37 -—5k+i—5j+2k = 3i-2j —3k
similarly

b+a=3t-27-3k° »

So,d+5=b+d

iii. Polygon Law of Addition of Vectors
The process for the addition of vectors can be extended to any number

of vectors. For instance, let we have five vectors G, b,é,d and é.
The sum of vectors 2+ b+2@+ d+ é@.
For this draw 1A = 4,AB = b, BC =@, CD = d, DE =

Nowa+ b+2+ d+ @=IA+AB+BC+CD+DE e
= (TA + AB) + BC + CD +DE Re 3
=TB+BC+CD+DE (=IA+AB =1B)
= (1B + BC) + CD + DE . c
=1C+CD+DE (- TB + BC = TC) .
= (IC + CD) +DE c
=ID+DE » (~ 16 + CD =1D) B
= TE (: IB + DE = 7B) f

Then JE is the sum of all these five vectors. aA

Same method can be adopted to find the sum ofany number of vectors.

This is called polygon law of addition of vectors.

iv. Subtraction of Two Vectors a b

Consider two non-zero vectors @ and b then @ — b = 4 + (—b). a Vi ;

a

To find @ —b draw AB = @ and BC = —5; then ° A

AB + BC = AC
a+(-b) =AC
Thus AC is the vector which represents a — b.

--- PAGE 77 ---
Example 2:

a = 21+ 77 + 4k and b = 61 — 4f — 3k

a—b = 28+ 77 + 4k — (61 — 47 — 3k)

&@—b = 21+77+4k -—61+47+3k
@—b=(2-6)t+ (7+ 47+ (443k
a-—b=si-j+k

v. Scalar Multiplication

If A is a non-zero scalar and d is a non-zero vector then the
scalar multiple A@ is a vector whose magnitude is |A| times
magnitude of G. Ad has the same direction as that of @ if A is
positive and if A is negative then direction of Ad is in the
opposite direction of a.

If Ad = 0 then either A= 0 or d = 0.

Example 3:

Let A = S and G = 107+ 97 +17k

Aa = 5(102 + 97 + 17k ) rh at
Ad = 50 + 457 + 85k :

Let AB be any line segment and P is the point which
divides this line segment in the given ratio m : n internally.

Because AP and PB have the same direction; so

From figure OA + AP = OP

And OP + PB = OB
=>?+PB=b

Substituting values in equation (1)

n(? — a) = m(b-7)

When the point P divides the line segment AB in the

Since the position vectors of the point of intersection of both the diagonals are same. Thus, they

This shows that length of M,M; is half the length of AB.
Theorem 3:The joining of the midpoints of the two non-parallel sides of a trapezium is parallel to

This shows that M, Mj is parallel to DCand AB..

Thus M, M; is parallel to the parallel sides. Also, from (1) it is clear that length of M, M, is half
the sum of the lengths of the parallel sides AB and DC.

3.2 Vectors in Space (Three-Dimensional Space) z-axis

3.2.1 Rectangular Coordinate System

To represent a vector in space we need a 3-dimensional
coordinate system. For this we consider three mutually
perpendicular lines interesting at a common point O
known as origin.

Any point in the space has some specific position

w. r. t. origin O i.e., We can locate the point by

moving specific distance along these three lines.
These three lines are known as coordinate axes and x-axis
are named as x-axis, y-axis and z-axis. The distance
2 along x-axis is called x-coordinate, the distance along y-axis is y-coordinate and the distance

along z-axis is z-coordinate of the point.
A general point in the space has coordinate (x, y, z).
This coordinate system to represent or locate a point is known as rectangular coordinate system
or Cartesian coordinate system and is denoted by R x R x R or R3. The set of all the points in
mae R3 = {(x, y,Z):X)y, Zz E R}.
3.2.2 Unit Vectors i,j and k 4
To represent a vector in space we need unit vectors in the direction of coordinate axes. For this
we have three fundamental unit vectors f, f and K along x- is, y-axis and z-axis respectively.
3.2.3 Components ofa V ector
Let OP be the position vector
of the point P(x, y, z), then
! OA = xt; OB = yj and
OC = zk
: From figure it is clear that
OP = 00 + QP (1)

z-axis

=xi+ yj = 09
Or 00 = xt + yj

Also OP = zk

--- PAGE 82 ---
Putting values in equation (1), we have:
OP = xi+ yj+zk
Which is the position vector of the point P(x, y, z).
In the representation of the position vector OP = xi+ yj + zk, x,y and z are known as
components of the vector along x-axis, y-axis and z-axis respectively.
3.2.4 Analytical Representation of the Vector

Two vectors in space 7, = x,f+ y,j +2,k and #, = x,f+ ¥2j + 22k are said to be equal if they
have the same corresponding components. i.e.;
7 =?

iii. Zero Vector
A vector in space which has all its three components equal to zero is called zero vector. It is
usually denoted by O. i.e.;
G6 = 08+ Of + Ok
iv. Negative of a Vector
For a vector in space 7 = xf + yf + zk negative of 7 is denoted by —7 and is defined as:
—F = (-x)i+ (—y)j + (—z)k

The product of a scalar A with a vector in spacer? = xf + yf + zk is denoted by A7
and is defined as
A? = (Ax)i + (Ay)j + (zk
vi. Parallel Vectors
Two non-zero vectors in space 7, = x; + y,f + 2,k and 7, = x2 + yof + zk are said to be
parallel if there exists some non-zero scalar A such that 7, = A7}. i.e.;

Addition of Vectors

Consider two vectors 7, = x,f+ yf + z,k and #% = x2f+ yf + z2k in space. Their sum
7, + 7, is defined as:
Att, = (xyh+ yf + 2k) + (x28 + yof + 22k)
= (x, + x2)8 + (1 + ¥2)f + (@ + 22)k.
Subtraction of two yectors .
Consider two vectors 7, = x,1+ y,f +2,k and?, = x,f+ y2f + z,k in space. Their difference

3.3. Properties of Vector Addition
3.3.1 Commutative Law for Vector Addition
Statement: For any two vectors 7, and 7, in space 7, + 7, = 7, +7.
Proof: Let 7, = x,i + vas + 2k and #, = x2i + yoj + 2k
Thus A +% =(xyf+ yf t+ zk) +(xett yof + 22k)
= (x, +x2)8 + (1 + Y2)f #2 + 22)k
Since X1,%z, V1» ¥2» 21, Zz € IR and commutative law w. r. t. addition holds in IR, so we may write
A +% = (24+ x)it+ Ost yd tG@.+ adk

3.3.2. Associative Law for Vector Addition
Statement: For any three vectors 7,, 7, and 7 in space; 7, + (7 +73) = (A+) +7
Proof: Let #, = x,f+ yif + 2k, 7 =xol+ yof + 22k and 7#, = x3i+ yaf+ 23k
7, +7, = X_h+ Yop + zk + x3 + yah + 23k

Since X4, X2,X3, Va» Ya Ya Z1» Zz 23 € IR and associative law holds in R w. r. t. addition so, we

may write:
#, + (F +7) = [Cx + x2) + xs] + [O11 + 2) + Ys]f + [1 + 22) + 25)k

3.4.2 Identity Vector for Addition
For any vector? and null vectorO , +0 =O0+r =7
Let 6 = 02 + Of + OK be the null vector and # = xt + yf + zk be any vector in space. Now
O+7 = (0+ Of + OK) + (xt+ yj + zk)
=(0+x)i+(O+y)ft+(O0+z)k
Since 0 is the additive identity of real numbers; so,
O+f=xit+ yj+zk=7
: Also
#40 =(xt+ yf+zk)+(0t+ Of + 0k)
= (x + 0)i+(y + 0)f + (z+ O)k
=xit+ y[+zk=7
Therefore, O+7 =? +06 =7 :
This shows that O is the identity for the vector addition.
3.3.4 Additive Inverse in Vectors
Let? be any vector then — 7 is called additive inverse of 7 if #7 + (—7) =(-7) +7 =O
Consider any vector # = xi + yj + zk in space, then —7 = (—x)i + (—y)j + (—z)k. Now
P+ (-#) =(xt+ yf+ zk) + {(—x)t+ (—y)j + (—z)k}
= (x + (—x))i+ (y+ (-y))j + (2 + (-2))k
= Of + Of + Ok
=6
and (-7) + # = {(-—x)i+ (—y)j + (—2)k} + (xt + yf + zk)
= ((—x) + x)i + ((—y) + Dj + ((—z) + 2k
= Of + Of + OK

Therefore, 7+ (-#) =(-7)+7=0

This shows that —7 is the additive inverse of 7.

The reason for the angle to be taken —@ is that for b- @ angle will be measured from btoa

Particular Cases:

3.5.4 Condition for Orthogonality of Two Vectors
Consider two non-zero vectors d and b in space. Let 4 = a,f + apf + agk
and b = byt + bof + bak
a and b will be orthogonal (perpendicular) to each other if and only if 4.5 = 0

=> (a,i+ af + ask). (b,t + b2j + b3k) = 0

=> a,b, + a,b, +a3b, = 0
Which is the condition for the two vectors a and b to be orthogonal to each other.

Proof: Let @ = a, + a2f + a3k and b = by? + bof + bgk be two vectors
 G.b = (ai + aaj + ask). (byi + bof + b3k)

Hence cos? a + cos? B+ cos*y = 1

- Sum of squares of direction cosines is unity.
Deduction:
Since cos*a +cos* B+cos*y = ?
=> (1 —sin* a) + (1—sin? £) + (1—sin*y) =1
=> 3 —sin* a —sin* B — sin? y = 1

Solution:
Consider two-unit vectors & = OP x-axis

a — B is the angle between @ and @. Since 2 = OP is the position vector of point P so, :

2 =cosai+sinaj. Similarly, #=cosBi+sinBj
Now, 2,8 = (cos i + sina j). (cos Bi + sin B f)

2.8 = cosacos B + sina sinB (1)
Also a. 6 = |f||6| cos(a — 8) = (1)(1) cos(a — B)

both the vectors d and b. @ is positive when measured
anticlockwise and is negative when measured clockwise.

3.6.5 Condition for the Two Non-Zero Vectors to be Parallel
Let a and B are two non-zero vectors. If a and B are parallel then angle between the vectors is
8 = 0°. So

a x b = |a||b| sino° A = |a||b|(0)A = 0
Also, if @ and B are anti-parallel then angle between the vectors is @ = 180°. So

@ x b = |a||b| sin 180°A = |a||b|(0)A = 0
Thus, if two non-zero vectors are parallel or anti-parallel then the value of their cross product is
zero vector.

3.6.8 Moment or Torque of a Given Force About a Given Point
The moment of a force is the turning effect
of the force about a point, and is the product
of the force and d; where d is the perpendicular
distance of the point from the line of action of
of the force.
From figure, moment of the force F acting at
point P about point O is
Moment = |0A||F|
From the right-triangle OAP;

oa = sin@; where @ is the angle between 7 and F.

=> |OA| = |?| sin@
Thus, moment = (|?| sin @)|F|
= |7||F| sin @
Moment =7 x F
The vector M = # x F, is called vector moment of the force F.

3.7 Scalar Triple Product
3.7.1 Scalar Triple Product of Vectors
The scalar product of two vectors in which one vector is already a cross product of two vectors is

called scalar triple product. If one vector is G and other is b x 2, then their scalar triple product is
a: (b x 2). It is also denoted by [a 5 é].

3.7.2 Scalar triple product in form of components

Consider the vectors a,b and é such that: Key Facts
a =ayi+aj+a,;k (a- b) x @ is meaningless. because

a
b = byt + bj + bk @-b is a scalar and will not have
c = Cf + cof +cegk wal cross product with ¢. Thus, there
aa should be no confusion in writing
bxé=|b, by bg | a+ (Bx 2) asa-bxé.
C, Ce 63
b x 2 = (b2c3 — b3c)t — (byc3 — bycy)f + (by¢q — bzc,)k

Therefore, ;

= a; (b2c¢3 — b3c2) — a2(byc3 — b3c,) + a3(b,cz — b2¢;)

Q@ a2 a3

If any two vectors in the scalar product are same or parallel then the two rows of the determinant
will be same, then the value of the determinant is zero. i.e, @: b x @ = 0

If we interchange any two vectors in the scalar triple product then the corresponding rows of the
determinant will be interchanged producing the value of new scalar triple product as a negative
multiple of the original product.

3.8 Application of Vectors in Real World

Vectors can be used by air-traffic controllers when tracking planes, by meteorologists when
describing wind conditions, and by computer programmers when they are designing virtual
worlds. In this section, we will present some applications of vectors that are commonly used in
the study of physics: work, torque, and magnetic force.

--- PAGE 113 ---

component of (u sin ¢—g t) and the horizontal component of u cos ¢ under components of vector.

We cut the pencil at an angle. The component of force in the direction perpendicular to the pencil
cuts the pencil. The component of force in the direction parallel to the pencil removes the thin
wooden part.

3.8.3 Earth’s magnetic field

Earth’s magnetic field has two components B and H which are perpendicular to Earth’s surface

and parallel to the surface.

Pendulum
The tension in the string has two components to balance the weight and to give the centripetal

force.

3.8.4 Digital graphics: Vector art can be defined as digital graphics using mathematical formulas to
construct shapes and lines. Vector images maintain their quality irrespective of size. This
adaptability makes vector file formats flexible, resilient, and always looking sharp. Vector artwork
is digital art produced with vector design software like Linearity Curve (formerly Vectornator),
Adobe Illustrator, and Sketch. These vector graphics editors generate simple shapes between
points instead of pixels. ,

Programing: A vector, in programming, is a type of array that is one dimensional. Vectors are a

logical element in programming languages that are used for storing a sequence of data elements of
the same basic type. Members of a vector are called components.

GPS Unit: When you use your GPS unit to get from point A to point B. The GPS unit will give
you a distance (magnitude) and a direction. A vector is, therefore, a directed quantity: a number
with a direction.

Example 28; An air-plane is flying with an airspeed of 475 km/h on heading of 70°. If an 80 km/h
wind is blowing from a true heading of 120°. Determine the velocity and direction of plane relative

continues without bound and is an infinite sequence.

The list of positive odd numbers :
lA JJ. 9,...
is an example of a typical infinite sequence. We’ use the symbol a, to denote the nth term of a
given sequence. Thus, in the above sequence; a, = 1, az = 3, a3 = 5 and so on, the first term is
a, = 1, but there is no last term.
The list of positive odd numbers less than 100 is:

This is an example of finite sequence. The last term is 99. This sequence contains 50 terms.
There are several ways to display a sequence.

Sequences: If the domain of function fin the set of positive integers, then the element of f(x) is
its range can be arranged in order of increasing n:

SQ), F2),fB)..-, FO)...

For example if n is a positive integer, then the first several elements in the range of:

Functions whose domain are the entire set of positive integers are given a special name.
Definition:

Sequences: A sequence is a function whose domain is the set of positive integers. :

Terms: Rather than using the customary function f(x), a sequence usually denoted by symbol
{ a, }. The terms of the sequence are formed by letters n take on the values 1,2,3,... in the general
term a,. Thus, { a, } is equivalent to:

‘+t bf
P23. My.

A much better way to describe a sequence is to give a formula for the mth term a,,. This is also
called a formula for the general term. For example, a, = 2m — 1 is the general term for the
sequence of odd numbers.
Consider the sequence 2, 4, 8, 16,...
Here, firstterm: a, =2'=2
second term? a,=2?=4
thirdterm: a@,=2>=8
The general term is @_ = 2"
This sequence can also be written as: ’

Note that the expression (—1)" causes the signs of the terms to alternate between positive and
negative, depending on whether n is even or odd.

Solution: (j) There are squares of consecutive positive integers.
So, the general term is n’ ie. a, =n’.

4.2 Arithmetic Sequence

A professional race car driver drives out of a curve. He enters the straight away at 119.9 mph. He
increases his speed by 78.3 mph and after 9 seconds his speed is 198.2 mph.

The table below shows how his speed increased each second after entering the straight path.

--- PAGE 120 ---
From the table and graph, we observe the number and pattern. This set of numbers is an example
of a sequence. Each number in a sequence is called a term. The first term is symbolized by ay,
the second term by a, and so on to a,, the nth term. The sequence shown in the table contains
ten terms. Therefore, a;=119.9, ag= 128.6 and ay9 = 198.2 (each term is obtained by adding 8.7
to the previous term). A sequence of this type is called an arithmetic sequence or arithmetic
progression(A.P). The number added to find the next term of an arithmetic sequence is
called the common difference and is symbolized by the variable d.

*

Explanation: In as arithmetic sequence, all terms (other than the first) can be found by adding
the same number to the preceding term. For example, the sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, ... is
arithmetic because adding 3 to any term produces the next term. In other words, the difference

between any term and the proceeding one is 3. Arithmetic panes are also called arithmetic
progressions (A.P). ‘

To find the next terms in an arithmetic sequence, first find the common difference d by
subtracting any term from its succeeding term, then add the common difference to the last term
to find successive terms, -
Example 3: Find the next four terms of the arithmetic sequence 33, 39, 45...
Solution: Find the common difference d by subtracting two consecutive terms.
d= 39-33=6 or d=45-36=6.

Now add 6 to the last term of the sequence and then continue saciid until the next four terms are
found.

a4 = 45+6=5l, as = §51+6=57

ag = 57+ 6=63, a7 = 63+6=69
The next four terms of the sequence are 51, 57, 63, and 69.
In this way terms of an arithmetic sequence are formed.

4.2.1. Formula for the nth Term of an Arithmetic Sequence (A.P)
The nth term a,,, of an arithmetic sequence with first term a, and common difference d is given by
a, =a,t+(n-—l1)d
This is known as recursive formula.

Note that the coefficient of d in each case is | less than subscript.
Example 4; Suppose a race car driver increases speed at constant rate. What will his speed be
after 15 seconds, if his initial speed is 85 mph and his rate of acceleration is 4.5 mph per second?
Solution: a, =85 and d=4.5, ay,.=? (After 15 sec means we have to find a;¢ term)
Find ay, using a, =a, +(n-1)d

Aye = 85 + (16 — 1) (4.5)

aig = 152.5
His speed will be 152.5 mph after 15 seconds.

Example 5: The third term of an arithmetic sequence is 8, and the sixteenth term is 47. Find a,, d
and construct the sequence. Also find a,>.

Solution: We know that a3 = 8 and a;, = 47. We need first term a, and d (common difference).

az = 8 (Here n = 3)
So, =a,+(3-l)d = 8=a,+2d (i)
and oe (Here n = 16)
Qi¢ = @,+ (16-—1)d = 47=a, + 15d (ii)
Solving (i) and (ii), we have
a,=2, d=3 ;
So, a,=2, a3 =a, + 1d=2+3=5, a3 =a, +2.d=2+6=8,

Q4=Q,+3.d=2+9=11~°

4.2.2 cieiienbis Mean

To find arithmetic mean between two numbers a and 5, we use formula
a tT ie a+b
A number A is said to be arithmetic mean (A.M) between two numbers a and b if a,
A, b are in A.P.
If dis the common difference, then
d = A-a=b-A

24 =atb
A aw tt

Example 6: Find the four arithmetic means between 19 and 54.
Solution: We can use the nth term formula to find the common difference. .
In the sequence 19, : ies , 54; we have, a, = 19 and ag = 54.
To find d, use ag = a, + 5d

54=19+5d = d=7
Use a, = 19 and d=7 to find the four arithmetic means

a2 =a,+d =19+7 = 26
a3 =a,+2d =19+2(7) =33
a, =a,+3d =19+3(7) =40
ads =a,+2d =19+4(7) =47

The four arithmetic means are 26, 33, 40 and 47.

4.3 Arithmetic Series

A sky driver falls freely covering the distance in the following pattern. These free-fall distances
form an arithmetic sequence. 16, 48, 80, 112, 144, 176, ...

To find out what the total distance coverd by the sky diver is, we would add the terms in the
sequence. 16+ 48+ 80+ 112+ 144+ 176

The indicated sum of the terms of a sequence is called a series. Above series is called an
arithmetic series.

Definition: Arithmetic Series: An arithmetic series is the some the terms in an arithmetic

sequence. An arithmetic sequence is a numbers in which the difference between consecutive
. terms is constant.

Following are the examples of arithmetic sequences and their corresponding arithmetic series.

5’s’ 5’ 5 S 8 s 3S
G1, Az, Az, A4,..., Ay ; a, +a, +@3 +a, t,....+ Ay

The symbol S, is used to represent the sum of the first n-terms of a series. For example, Ss means
the sum of the first four terms of a series. For example, the sum of series 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 is 30. Ifa
series has a large number of terms, it is not convenient to list all the terms and then find their sum.

4.3.1 Sum of nth term of A.P
To develop a general formula for the sum of any arithmetic series, let’s consider the series of sky
diving distances.
16 +48 + 80+ 112 + 144+ 176
We write Ss in two different orders and find the sum.
Ss = 16+48 + 80+ 112+ 144+ 176

+ Se6= 176+ 144 + 112+ 80+ 48 + 16

2S6 = 192 + 192+ 192+192+192+192 ....  Stimes 192 (6 sums of 192)
=6 [192] => Se=$[192] (Divide each side by 2)
‘ Here, 6 represents n, 192 represents the sum of the first and last terms (16 +76) i.e. a,+ a,. We
can replace the equation with the formula:

‘ Sn= 5 [ay+ ay] — @
We have learnt that in an arithmetic sequence, a, = a, + (n— 1) d. Using this formula(i), we get
another version for the sum of an arithmetic sequence. 3

44 Geometric Sequence

Iodine is used medically as a tracer isotope in monitoring the activity of the thyroid gland. A patient
is given a compound containing the radioactive iodine. The amount of iodine retained by this gland
is a measure of its ability to function.

Iodine has a half-life of about 8 days. That means approximately every 8 days, half the mass of
iodine decays into another element. Then in the next 8 days, half of the remaining iodine decays,
and so on.

Suppose a container hold a mass of 64 milligrams of iodine. To find the remaining mass of iodine
after each half-life, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, and 0.5, are what type of patterns do you suggest?

The pattern of masses forms a sequence of numbers known as a geometric sequence or geometric
progression. The terms in this example are 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, and 0.5.

Explanation: In an arithmetic sequence, we added a certain number to each term to get the next
term. With the kind of sequence we consider now, each term is multiplied by the certain number
to get the next term. Then are called geometric sequence or geometric progressions (G.P).

Consider the sequence: 2, 6, 18, 54, 162,...

If we multiply each term by 3, we obtain the next term. Sequence in which term cab be multiplied
by a certain number in order to get the next term are called geometric. We call this multiplier the
‘common ratio’ because it is found be dividing any term by the preceding term.

In any geometric sequence, the common ratio r is found by dividing any term by the previous term.
Example 13: Find the next two terms of the geometric sequence 4, 12,.and 36.

Solution: To find the common ratio, find the quotient of any two consecutive terms.
~ = = = 3; the common ratio is 3.

The fourth term = 36 (3) = 108

The fifth term = 108 (3) = 324

“. The next two terms of the geometric sequence are 108 and 324.

4.4.1 Formula for the nth Term of a Geometric Sequence

Successive terms of a geometric sequence are usually expressed in the product of r and the previous

term. Thus, a geometric sequence is also a recursive sequence. Each succeeding term in a GP
contains a factor ofr, each term can be expressed as a product ofr:

--- PAGE 127 ---
We derive the formula for GP using previous example: Observe the following table-

ee ee eee eee
4 | 4@)=12 | 46)=36 | 4@)=108] .].|.]-|.]|.| 40" |
ae eo ee Ae

The nth term a, of a geometric sequence with first term a, and the common ratio r is given by

Example 14: Write the first five terms of a geometric sequence in which a, = 5 and r= 2.
Solution: Given a, = 5. Write next term using formula; a, =a,r"~!
a, =a,r2-1=a,;r =(5)(2) =10 (Substituting values a, = 5, r= 2 and n=2, 3, 4, 5)

. a3 =a,r*~* = a,r? =(5) (2)? = 20
a4= © PR = a,r? = (5) (2)3 = 40
, as = a,r°—* =a,r* = (5) (2)* = 80

“. The first five terms of a sequence are 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80.
Example 15: Find the seventh term, a7, of a geometric sequence in which a, = 96 and r= 4.
Solution: The general form of the third term of a sequence is a,r* (a,r3~*).
We have a3 = 96,r=4,a7=?
a3 = a,r?
96 = a, (4)*; (we need ato find a,)
96 = a,(16) => a,=6
Thus, a7 = a,r® = (6) (4)® = 24,576.
Example 16:
Mr. Khalid saves Rs. 1000 on the first day. Then each day thereafter, saves double the amount he
saved the day before. Find the amount he should save the 20th day of the month.
Solution:
In this sequence, a; = 1000. Since the amount of money is twice that of day before, so r = 2.
Qn = ar"! > azo=?
G29 = ay77°~? = ayr?? = (1000) (2)'”
Az9 = 524288000
On the 20th day, Khalid should save Rs. 524,288,000.
4.5 Geometric Mean

° If a, G, b is in a geometric sequence, then G is called the geometric mean of a and b.
From geometric sequence a, G, b, we have :

Example 18: Find two geometric means between 81 and 3.

Solution: The sequence is 81, ; » 3.
Use the general formula for the nth term to find the value of r.

Since a, =8l,a,=3,n=4.
So, a,=a,r"-1 becomes a, =a,r* or 3=81 (r)?

r= = = (r= (=) (taking cube)

a, = a,r=81 (=) =27

a, =a,r* =81 (:)= 9
The missing geometric means are 27 and 9.
Example 19:A vacuum pump removes : of the air from a sealed container on each stroke of its
piston. What percent of the air remains after five stroke of the piston?

Solution:
Let | represent the original amount of air. After the first stroke, 1 -= or : of the air remains.

The second stroke removes : of the remaining air.

Thus the amount that remain after two strokes is ; ( 1 Fi 3 5 or 35

This pattern can be expressed as a geometric sequence.

We want to find a formula for S,, when sequence is geometric as given below.

The geometric series S,, (sum of n terms) is given by:
Sy =@,+a,r2+a,r? +@yr3t+ s+ +ayr™? +a,yr"™ (1)

If we multiply both sides of equation (1) by 7, we have
rS, =ayr+ayr?+ayr3+ °*) +ayr™*+a,r" (2)
Subtracting corresponding sides of equation (2) form equation (1), we get:
Sp —1Sy= @, — ar"
or Sy (1 -r) =a, (1-r")
Dividing on both sides by 1 — r gives the following formula:

The first swing of a pendulum measures 25cm. The lengths of the successive swings of the
pendulum form the geometric sequence 25, 20, 16, 12.8,...
Suppose the pendulum continues to swing back and forth indefinitely then the sequence shown
above becomes an infinite geometric sequence.

In the series, a, = 25 andr== = 0.8
So, the series can be expressed as:

Look for a pattern in the values of (0.8)" as n increases.

4.7 Harmonic Sequence

A sequence of numbers is called a harmonic sequence or harmonic. progression (H.P) if the

reciprocals of its terms are in yee progression.

For example, the sequence; i= 3 > = . is a harmonic sequence because the inact of its |

terms are |, 4, 7,10,. . . which form an arithmetic sequence.

A sequence is simply an ordered list. For example, wh Il coach writes a batti 2 order,
a sequence is being formed. When the members of a seq 6 numbers, we can find their
sum. Such a sum is called a series.

| 4.8.1 Sigma Notation fon,
When the general term of a sequence is known, the Greek letter £( can be used to write a
series. For example, the sum of the first four terms of the sequence 3, 5, 7,9, .&, 2k + 1, can

: be named as follows, using sigma notation or summation notation; oS

This is read as, “the sum as k goes from | to 4 of (2k + 1):” The letter k is called the index of
summiation.

Solution:
a) 1+44+9+16+25
This is a sum of squares i.e. 1? + 2? + 37 + 4% + 5. So, the general term is k? and its sigma

notation is,
Deas
b) -1+3-5+7
Except for the alternating signs, this is the sum of the first four positive odd numbers.
Note that 2k — 1 is a formula for the kth positive odd number and (—1)* = 1, when k is even
and (—1)* =—1, when k is odd. .
The general term is thus (—1)* (2k — 1), beginning with &= 1.
So, its sigma notation is:
Dhar (-D* (2k - 1)
c) 3+9+27+81 +...

This is the sum of powers of 3, and it is also an infinite series. We use the symbol « to
represent infinity and name the infinite series using sigma notation as follows: '

4.9 Arithmetico—Geometric Series
In mathematics, arithmetico-geometric sequence is the result of term-by-term multiplication of a
geometric progression with the corresponding terms of arithmetic progression. The nth term of
an arithmetico-geometric sequence is the product of the mth term of an arithmetic sequence and
the nth term of a geometric sequence. Arithmetico-geometric sequence arise in various
applications such as the computation of expected values in statistics and other fields. For
instance thé sequence

is an iii cee act a sequence, The arithmetic component appears in the numerator and
geometric one in the denominator.
The summation of this infinite sequence is known as arithmetic-geometric series.

Applications of Sequence and Series

Sequences and series have their own importance in many areas of Mathematics such as finance,

‘ statistics, population growth and physics. Most of the society and reality around us is based upon
sequence after sequence, changing and repeating themselves over and over again. Common
examples of this are time and calendrical system. Time (seconds, minutes, hours) always follow
the same sequence, which always contains the same number of elements. Our lives are ruled over
by sequences such as the routines that we follow every day without knowing leading to their
great importance in the structure and function of the modern world.

Example 36: Khalid is saving for a new car. He deposits Rs. 100,000 into his account and then each
month he deposits in Rs. 10,000 more than the month before. If the price of the car is
Rs. 1,260,000; find:

The amount Khalid has saved in four months.
The time in which Khalid reaches his goal of Rs. 1,260,000.

Solution:

Since Khalid deposits same amount every month, therefore, we will use arithmetic series.
Let a, = 100000, d= 10000, 5 ,=?
S, = 5(2a+(n-1d]

S,=5[2(a)+ (4-H)
S, = 2[2(100000)+ (3)10000]

S, = 460000

Therefore, amount saved in 4 months = Rs. 460,000
ii. Let Sa = 126,0000, d= 10000, a = 100000, n=?

S, = 5[2a+(n=1)d]

S, = 2[200000) + 30000]

--- PAGE 146 ---
126,0000 =5 [2(100000)+ (n—1)10000]
= n[190000 n +100000)
2520000 = 190000 » + 10000n?

n’ + 19n—252=0
n’ + 28n-9n—252 =0
n(n + 28)—9(n +28) = 0
(n—9) (n +28) =0
n =9,n=— 28 (n cannot be negative)

Khalid will reach Rs. 1,200,000 in the9”month.

Example 37: A new virus is on a remote area. On day one, there were 10 people infected, with
the number of new infections increasing at a rate of 40% per day.

i. Find the expected number of infected people on the 7 day.
ii. Find the expected number of infected people during week (7 days).
Solution:

i. As the infection is increasing in percentage, therefore it is the problem of geometric
sequence series.

Let a,=10, r=1.4 [40% increasing so r= (100 + 40)% = 140% = 1.4], a;=?

5.3 Remainder Theorem
To understand reminder theorem, consider the following example:

Example 1: If we have two polynomials
p(x) = x° - 6x? + 14x-8 and d(x) =x —2, then dividing p(x) by d(x), we

can find the quotient and remainder as follows.
x’ —4x+6 < Quotient

Divisor +> x-2) x? —6x? +14x—-8 < Dividend

x 2x"
- +

—4x7 +14x
<4x? +8x
6x-8
+6x=12

4 < remainder

--- PAGE 153 ---
So, quotient = x*7-4x+6and remainder = 4
Here
quotient x divisor + remainder = (x? —4x + 6) (x-2)+4
= x(x? —4x+6)-2 (7? -4x +6) +4
= 9 —4° + 6x-2x7 + 8x-12+4
= x» -6r +14x-8
= dividend
Here, (x — 2) is the divisor of x’ — 6x? + 14x- 8.
If we put x= 2 in the dividend , we have,
p (2) = (2) -6 (2) + 14(2)-8
= 8-6(4)+28-8
= 8-24+28-8
= 36 -32
= 4 remainder
Hence, p(2) gives us same remainder which we have got by long division.
ie. p(2) = remainder
. We can deduce that, if a polynomial x°— 6x +14x — 8 is divided by a polynomial x — 2, the
remainder is 4 and the value of dividend at x = 2 also equals remainder.
Conclusion: If p(x) = x 6° + 14x — 8 <— dividend
d(x) =x-2 «< divisor
then, remainder = p(2) = 4

Statement: If a polynomial p(x) is divided by x— c (where c is a constant), then the remainder is p(c).
Proof: Let q(x) be the quotient and r be the remainder. When p(x) is divided by (x — c), then

p(x)= (x-c) q(x) tr...... (i) We know that:
Substituting x =c in result (i) , we have dividend = quotient x divisor + remainder.
p(c)=(c-c)q(c)+r
=0+r =r, which is the remainder.

Hence, p(c) is the remainder when p (x) is divided by x —c.
Example 2; Find remainder if x°— 5x + 7x — 6 is divided by x — 3.

Solution: Let p(x) =x — 5x* + 7x—6 Key Facts

5.3.1 Zeros of a Polynomial - Memory Plus
Consider an equation, 2x +5 =9
2x+5=9 The zeros of p(x) = x?— 9 are the same
or+ Se $mQ—5 as the solution to the equation x?— 9 = 0.
2x=4
or “g¢=92

Here ‘2’ is called the root of 2x + 5 = 9, as it satisfies the equation.
Hence, the roots of a polynomial p(x) means the values of x that satisfies p(x) = 0. These roots are

called ‘zeros of the polynomial’.

The values of x which satisfy p(x) = 0 are called ‘Zeros of the Polynomial p(x)’.
For example 5 and —S5 are the zeros of the polynomial p(x) =x? — 25, because

p(5)  =(5)-25
=25-25 =0

and p(-5) =(-5)-25
=25-25 = 0

Basically, when we are finding zeros of a polynomial, we are looking for those values of x which
cause the values of polynomial equal to zero.

Example 4: Is -3 a zero of polynomial p (x) = 2 x4 + 7x >— 4x? — 27x ~ 18?

Solution: ‘—3’ will be a zero of p(x) = 2x4+ 7x — 4x*- 27x - 18, If p(—3) =0

p (-3) = 2(-3)* + 7(-3)°— 4(— 3)? — 27(— 3) — 18
= 2 (81) + 7(— 27) —4(9)— 27 (-3 )- 18
= 162 — 189—36+81-18
= 243-243 =0

Hence, ‘—3’ is the zero of p(x).

Example 5: If zeros of a polynomial are 0 , 6 , —1, find the polynomial. ‘
Solution: Let required polynomial be g(x). Then setting x = 0 , 6 , -1, we have
a(x) = (x — 0) x — 6) (+ 1)

5.4° Factor Theorem :
Factor Theorem is a result of Remainder Theorem and is based on the same reasoning.
Statement: A polynomial p(x) has a factor x — c, if and only if p(c) = 0.
Proof: Let q (x) be the quotient and r be the remainder when p(x) is divided by (x — c)
then, p(x)=(x—-c)q(x)tr ....... (i)

| 7 PEE re Key Facts

If x—c is a factor of p (x), then r = 0. Every factor is a divisor but every

Now by Remainder Theorem, r = p(c) a) divisor is not a factor of polynomial.
’  ¥. remainder = p (c) = 0 ° of # m..ynomial divides it

Conversely, if p(c)=0, thatmeans, remainder =O [LO
Therefore, result (i) reduces to ‘
P(x) = (xc) q (x)
. &—Cc) is a factor of p(x).

Hence, (x — c) will be the factor of p(x) if and only if p(c) = 0.

Difference between reminder and factor theorem: The reminder theorem tells us that for any
polynomial P(x), if you divide it by the binomial x- a, the reminder is equal to the value of P(a).
The factor theorem tells us that if a is a zero of the polynomial P(x), then (x -a) is a factor of P(x)
and vice-versa.

Solution: Let f(x) =(« + 2)°+ (3x +k) ... (i) d(x) =x+3

5.5 Factorization of a Cubic Polynomial —

With the help of Factor Theorem together with some intelligent guessing, we can factorize
polynomials of higher degree. Consider a cubic polynomial,
f(x) =? - 2x7 - 5x +6
The process of factorizing above polynomial is explained as under.
Step-I: We can substitute, +1, +2, +3 and +4 to trace the roots by using factor theorem.
First try, x — 1.
Here, x—- sdideoke hehe upland deca S()) = 0— _ by Factor Theorem
f()= (1-2 (1)?-5 (1) +6
=1-2-5+6
=7-7=0
Hence, (x— 1) is a factor of f(x).

Step-Il: Divide x°— 2x*= 5x+6 byx—1 to find its other factor g(x).
x? -x-6

eee
So, (x= 2x*-5x+6)= («-1)(2x?-x-6).

Step-III: Factorize quadratic factor (if possible) for other linear factors.

x -2x°-5x+6
=(x-1)@?-x-6)
= (x- 1)(x*- 3x + 2x-6)
= (x — 1)[x(x — 3) + 2 - 3)] (-1) (+2)(-3) = + 6

= (x- 1)(x —3)(x +2)

Hence,
e ¥ -—2x7-5x+6=(x-1) (x-3) (+2)

(y — 2), find its third factor. $7 unknown factor

5.6 Applications of Remainder Theorem

If you give 10 pencils to five students out of 11, each student will get 2 pencils. Only one pencil will
remain with you and this leftover | pencil is called the remainder. 11 is the dividend, 5 is the divisor,
2 is the quotient and | is the remainder.

A remainder theorem formula is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a variety of
mathematical problems, A remainder formula is used to differentiate the polynomials.

Suppose Nasir hits a high fast ball straight up over home plate. The function that describes the
height of the ball after t seconds is

h(t) = -162? + 80¢ +5

The roots of the function tell us that at what times the
ball is theoretically in the ground. When ¢ =0, the
height of the ball is 5 feet. This is the point at which he
hits the ball.

Suppose we find the height of the ball after 4 seconds.
h(t) =16¢? +802+5

h(4) =-16(4)’ +80(4)+5  replacet with 4.

h(4) =69

After 4 seconds, the height of the ball is 69 feet. a RO Se, Se
Notice that the value of (4) is the same as the remainder when polynomial is divided by t-4.

Example 11: The volume of a rectangular solid is 72 cubic units. The width is twice the height and
the length is 7 units more than the height. Find the dimensions of the solid.
Let x be the height of the solid.
volume = (2x)(x + 7)(x)
72 = 2x? +14x?
x +7x? -36=0
Trace the possible zeros.

--- PAGE 160 ---
(2 +7(2)? -36=0

So, the zero is 2.
height = x =2

PERMUTATION AND COMBINATION

After studying this unit, students will be able to:

Explain and solve problems that involve the fundamental counting principle.
Explain and solve problems that involve permutations.
Explain and solve problems that involve combinations.

Apply the concept of permutation and combination to real world problems such
as (cryptography, estimating the odds of winning a lottery, calculating the
number of possible DNA sequences or protein structures, choosing different set
of songs for certain occasions.

Fundamental Principle of Counting

The history of counting is as old as the humanity is. Counting is a basic tool. How to count
correctly and quickly is very important in our daily life. For this purpose, we develop the
techniques for computing number of elements.in sets without listing them. To determine a
general rule, we consider a coin and a dice. A coin has two outcomes that is head and tail while a
die has six outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Then the outcomes of tossing a coin and rolling a die are
These outcomes are 12 in number. We can also find this number 12 without listing all outcomes.
We know that a coin has two outcomes while a die has six outcomes. So, the total outcomes are
the product of values of two things that is 2 x 6 = 12.

--- PAGE 163 ---
6.1 Rule of Product

If A can happens in m ways and B can happen in m ways then the pair (A, B) can happen in
m X nor mn ways. If we have three objects A, B and C which can happened in m, nm and p ways
respectively. Then tlie triplet (A, B, C) can be written in m X n X p or mnp ways. In this unit, we
will develop formulae and techniques for counting the number of objects. Then these formulae
will be used to calculate the number of arrangements of the objects.

6.2 Factorial Notation
Factorial notation was introduced by French mathematician Christian Kramp in 1808. Factorial
of an integer n is denoted by
ni= n(n—1)(n—2).. 3x2x1
and is defined as the product of all the positive integers from n down to 1.

6.3 Permutation

The number of ways in which r objects out of n objects 0 < r < n can be arranged in a definite

order is called permutation.

Example 3: Ifa vehicle number plate consists of four digits; then the different number plates
consisting of distinct digits from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 can be counted as follows.

Sage ei

6-choices 5-choices 4-choices 3-choices

For the first digit, we have 6 choices of digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. For the second digit, we have 5-
choices; because the selected digit cannot be selected again. Similarly, for the third digit, there
are 4-choices and for the fourth digit, we are left with 3-choices.

So, the total number of plates = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 = 360

Example 4: Suppose a student has four different subject’s books and wish to arrange them on a
shelf. In how many ways he can arrange the books, can be counted as follows.

For the first place he has 4 choices, for the second place he has 3 choices, for the third place he
has 2 choices and for the fourth place he has | choice.

Hence total number of arrangements are = 4 xX 3% 2 1 = 24 = 4!

So, we can conclude that if we have n distinct objects then total number of arrangements are ni.

6.3.1. Permutation of 1 Distinct Objects Taken r at a Time (0 < r < n)

Here we are going to generalize the above discussed counting process.

Let we have m number of distinct objects and we want to arrange r of them in some order.
We denote such arrangement by "P, and read it as n-permutation-r.

For the first object, we have n choices.

For the second object, we have n - 1 choices.

For the third object, we have n - 2 choices.

For the third object, we have n - 2 choices, and so on.

For the r™ object, we have [n - (r - 1)] = (n- r+ 1).

We write "P, in factorial form as:

“—pP,= n(n — 1)(n — 2)... (mn — r+1) ye Man -1 = 1)( n= 7 =2) 03.24

(n-r)(n-r—1)(n-r-2)...3.2.1

6.3.2. Permutation of n Objects When Some of Them are Alike (not Distinct)

Let we have total ‘n’ number of objects which are all not distinct. Suppose that there are ny
objects in 1* similar objects category, nz objects in the 2” similar objects category, and
similarly, n, objects in the k" similar objects category.
So, n = Ny + nz +73 ++ My.
Let X be the total number of permutations in this situation. If we consider all similar objects as
distinct objects in all the categories, then number of permutations for I* category are n,!, for =
category nz! and for the k” category n,!.
- We have X.n,!. nz! ...n,! number of permutations.

V/A so that the vowels always come together?

Example 7: In how many ways 8 people can sit around a circular table for dinner.
Solution:
Total number of people = n= 8
Number of permutations = (8 -- 1)! = 7! = 5040 ways
Example 8: There are 5 men and 5 women in a party. Find the number of ways in which they
can be seated at a round table if:
(i) anyone can occupy any seat, (ii) ~men and women have alternate seats.
Solution:
(i) Total number of persons = 5 + 5 = 10
Since there is no restriction, so they can sit in (10 -- 1)! = 9! ways.
} (ii) We can start either with men or women. If we start with men then they can be seated in
: (5-1)! ways
So, the total number of ways that 5 men and 5 women be seated at round table such that
they occupy alternative seats = 4! x 5! =24 x 120 = 2880

Now we consider the case in which the objects are arranged in a circular manner but we can
flip or turned over them.

6.4 Combinations

In permutation we arrange the shieetn | in some definite order. If in the arrangements of objects
their order is not important then this arrangement of objects is called combination.

Let, we have three objects a, b and c then abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba all are same. In
permutation we consider them all distinct, so there are 6 arrangements, but in combination all

‘ these aré same (since order is not important). Hence, we consider all these arrangements same

and consider them a single combination. The combination of r objects taken out of n distinct
objects is denoted by "C, or (*).

6.4.1 Prove that "C,=(") =—"—

Se ri(n-r)!
Proof: Let we have n distinct objects and we want to take r at a time where,0 <r <n. Let the .
total number of combinations be . i.e. X we take these r objects in some order then total number
of ways are r!, But in combinations all these r! ways will be treated as same that is one way.

i.e. 1! combination = 1 permutations
=> r!X = | permutation
Since, total number of permutations are "Pr. So,

7.1 Mathematical Induction

To illustrate the idea of mathematical
induction, envision an infinite sequence of
dominoes arranged in a line, where if one
domino falls backward, it causes the next
one to fall backward as well. Now, suppose
the first domino falls backward. What
occurs next? .. . They all fall down. (Fig. 7.1)

Fig. 7.1

If the kth domino falls backward, it will also push the (k + 1)th domino backward.

To establish the connection between this visualization and the principle of mathematical induction,
consider the sentence "The nth domino falls backward", denoted as P(n). It is known that for every
k > 1, if P(k) is true (the k” domino falls backward), then P(k + 1) is also true (the (k + 1)"
domino falls backward). Additionally, it is given that P(1) is true (the first domino falls backward).
Hence, according to the principle of mathematical induction, P(n) (the nth domino falls backward)
is true for every integer n> 1.

Solution:
The proposition P(n) n? — 3n + 4 is an even number for all positive integers.
Step 1: (Basis Step)
For n = 1; P(1) is 12 — 3(1) + 4 = 2 which is an even number. Thus P(1) is true.
Step 2: (Inductive Step) ,
P(k + 1) is true when P(X) is true. .
Let P(k) is true i.e.; k? — 3k + 4 is an even. Now P(k + 1) is:
(k +1)? -—3(k+1)+4=k? +2k4+1-3k—-344

= (k* —3k +4) +(2k+1-3)

= (k* — 3k +4) + (2k —2)

= (k? — 3k +4) + 2(k -1)
Which is an even because it is sum of two even numbers (k? — 3k + 4) and 2(k — 1).

7.2 Binomial Theorem

‘Bi’ mean two and ‘nominal’ mean terms. So, binomial mean an algebraic expression consisting
of two terms. e.g.,(x + y), (: - 9) , (x? + 4) etc all are binomials.

Often, we need some positive integral powers of binomial like square, cube or even higher powers.
Higher is the power the longer will be the expansion. To handle such problem we use binomial
theorem. General form of binomial expression is a (a + b)” whcre n is a positive integer, We can
expand the expression (a + b)” by using binomial theorem. Another way to expand (a +b)" is the
use of Pascal’s triangle.

--- PAGE 181 ---
7.2.1 Pascal’s Triangle

This triangle of positive integers is known as Pascal’s triangle. How the Pascal triangle is
helpful in the binomial expansion; observe some positive integral powers of (a + b)”.

forn =1 (a+b)'=a+b

forn = 2 (a + b)? = a* + 2ab + b?

forn = 3 (a + b)® = a® + 3a*b + 3ab? + b

forn = 4 (a + b)* = a* + 4a°b + 6a*b? + 4ab3 + bt
Observe that the binomial coefficients in the above expansion are.
forn = 1 1 1

forn = 2 1 2 1

forn = 3 1 3 3 1

forn = 4 1 a 6 4 1

Which are same as the first four rows of the Pascal’s triangle.

In this way we can find the binomial coefficients from the Pascal triangle by considering its n*”
row; for the expansion of (a + b)". Also from the above expansion note that, expansion starts
with a” and in each next term exponent of a is decreased by 1 and the exponent of b is
increased by 1. The expansion ends with the term b”.

Key Facts
Ea Expansion by using Pascal’s triangle is convenient when n is a small positive integer.

Example 6: Expand (1 + 2x)® with the help of pascal’s triangle.

2. . The sum of exponents of a and b in each term of the expansion of (a + b)" is n.

3. The coefficients of the terms equidistant from the beginning and the end are same.

4. Ifnis even then there will be odd number of terms in the expansion of (a + b)”. So the

n th n+2 th
middle term in this expansion is the (= + 1) = () term.

--- PAGE 184 ---
5. Ifn is odd then there will be even number of terms in the expansion of (a lineal
th

will be two middle terms in the expansion; these are (=) an a)" terms of the

expansion.
6. Inthe expansion of (a + b)", exponent of a is n and the exponent of b is zero in the first

term. In each next term exponent of a is decreased by 1 and the exponent of b is increased

by 1. In the last term exponent a becomes zero and the exponent of bis reached to n.
7. Any particular (r + 1)" term from beginning also known as general term in the expansion

of (a + b)" is given by

Tra. = ig a™-T pr

8. A term which is at r“" position from the end in the expansion - (a + b)” is at
(n + 2—r)" position from the beginning.

Applications of Binomial Theorem
The binomial theorem has a wide range of applications in Mathematics, like finding the remainder,
finding the digits of a number, etc. The most common binomial theorem applications are as
follows:
Finding the Last or Unit Place digit of an exponential number

Consider the table given below in which numbers are written in first column while their
exponents are written in the first row and it is showing only the unit place digits.

From the table, the unit place digits for 2 are as 2* = 2, 22 = 4,23 = 8, 2* = 16 and 2° = 32.
Since the unit digit is same as that of the number 2 therefore the cyclicity of 2 is 5 — 1 =4. In the
same manner we can find the cyclicity of other numbers. The cyclicity of 3, 7 and 8 is also 4. For
1, 5 and 6 the unit digit remains the same for all the exponents and for 4 the unit place digit is
either 4 or 6 whereas for 9 it is 9 or 1 only. Hence, we can say that if the exponent is of the form
4n, 4n+1, 4n+2 or 4n+3 then we can easily find the value of the unit place digits of all the
numbers.

--- PAGE 191 ---
Example 13: Find the unit digit of: (i) 177° (ii) 297 ~— (iii) - 36397

Solution:
(i) 17293
Now 203 can be written as:
203 = 4x 50+3
Since, the remainder is 3 so, 73 = 343
Hence the unit place digit of 177° is 3.
(ii) 2926
As in case of 9 from the table we can see that there are only two values i.e.; 9 and 1.
So, write 26 as 4 x 6+ 2, Hence remainder is 2 that is 9? = 81. Unit place digit of 9° is 1.
(iii) 36907 od /
As the unit place digit is 6 which always remains 6 at unit place, so 363°” has 6 at unit place.
Finding Remainder Using Binomial Theorem

Example 17: Find the last two digits of the number (13)!°.

A multiple of 100 + 5(170) — 1 = 100k + 849

.. The last two digits are 49.

Relation between Two Numbers

The method is explained with th help of example.
Example 18: Which one is greater 995° + 100°’ or 1015?

Solution:
101*° can be written as:

101°°= (100 + 1)°= 100% + 50. 1009+ 25 . 49. 1008+...

99°" can be written as:

=> 99 = (100 — 1) = 100°°— 50 . 1007 + 25. 49. 100**— ....

Now, 101°°— 99% = 2[50 . 1004? + 25(49) (16) 100*7+ ...]
= 100+ 50.49.16. 10077+ ... >100°°

=> 101°°> 100% + 99%

Divisibility Test

The divisibility test means that we want to to check weather a number is complelety
divisible by the other number. Mean when a number is divided by another number and the
remainder is zero then this is known as the divisibility of a number with another one. If a number
is to large and we want to check that it is divisible by other number this method is explained in
the following example. :

Example 19: Show that 11°+ 9"! is divisible by 10.

The formula for the distance between two points whose
coordinates are (x, »)) and (x2, y2) is:

d= AB= V(x; -x,J + (y, ~y,) AG y1) B(x, y2)
This is called the distance formula. ,
For example, if A(5, 4) and B(3, 2) are two points in the plane then distance between A and B is:

AB = V(x, -»F +0,-»,) = ¥(5-3/) + (4-2)

8.3 Trigonometric Ratios of Allied Angles

The angles connected with basic angles of measure @ by a right angle or its multiple, are

called allied angles. ;
If Bis a basic angle, then angles of measure ~+0,7 £0, + 0,22+6 etc. are called
allied angles. 2

The following trigonometric ratios can be derived easily with the help of fundamental
theorem of trigonometry and its deductions.

trigonometric ratio changes to its co-ratio when allied angle contains
an odd multiple of right angle. For example sine ratio changes to
cosine ratio and vice versa.
(ii) | A trigonometric ratio does not change when allied angle contains an
even multiple of right angle.
(iii) | The sign of ratio will change according the position of terminal arm of
angle in the quadrant.
(iv) The above results are also valid for the reciprocals of ratios of sine, cosine
and tangent.

Example 2: Use (60° — 45°) = 15° to find the exact value of:

s (i) cos15° (ii) sin15° (iii) tan 15°
’ Solution: Letting a =60° and # = 45°, we have:
rt : (i) cos(a—£)=cosacosf+sin asin B

cos 15° = cos(60° — 45°) = cos 60° cos 45° + sin 60° sin 45°
cos15° = 0.5x 0.707 + 0.866 x 0.707
cos15° =0.3535+ 0.6123 = 0.966

(ii) sin( a—£)=sin acos 8—cosasin B

--- PAGE 200 ---
sin 15° = sin( 60° 45°) = sin 60° cos 45° —cos60° sin 45°
sin 15° = 0.866 0.707 —0.50.707
sin 15° = 0.6123—0.3535 = 0.259

8.4 Expressing asin@ + bcos@ in the form r sin(@+@)

Let P(a, b) be a point in the coordinate plane and
let @ be the angle that OP makes with x-axis as shown in

the figure.
If we let a= rcos¢ and b=rsing, then

asin@ +bcos@ =rcos¢sin@ + rsingcos@

Where r = Va? +5? and ¢ = wn =)

Example 5:

Solution: If we compare 12sin@ + Scos@ with rcos@sin@ + rsing cos@, then:
a=12=rcos¢ andb=5=rsing

So, r=Va? +b? =(12) +(5f =V/169 =13

8.6 Sum, Difference and Product of Sines and Cosines
8.6.1 Expressing the Product of Sines and Cosines as Sums or Differences
We have proved the following identities:

sin(a + f)=sin acos#+cosasin 8 (21)

sin(a—{)=sin acos $—cosasin B (22)

cos(a + #) =cosacos 8 —-sin asin 8 (23)

cos(@ — 8) =cosacos #+sin asin 8 (24)
Addition of identities (21) and (22), and then (23) and (24) gives:

sit a+ $)+ sin a—f)=2sin acos P (25)

cos(a + #)+cos(a — 8)=2cosacos 8 (26)
Subtracting (22) from (21), we get:

sin a+ B)— sin( a — 8)=2cosasin B (27)
Now, subtracting (24) from (23), we get: «

cos(a + )—cos(a — 8)=—2sin asin 8 (28)

Identities (25) to (28) can be re-written as:

2sin axcos f =sin( a+ f)+ sin(a—f)
2cosasin f =sin a+ f)=' sin(a— )

2cosacos B=cos(a+ B)+e0s(a- —f)

9.1 Domain and Range of Trigonometric Functions
The domain of a function f(x) is the set of all possible values of ‘x’ such that function f(x) is
defined. The range of a function f(x) is the set of all possible values the function f(x) can take,

when ‘x’ is any number from the domain of the function.

Let ‘8’ be any real number. Construct the angle
whose measure is @ radian, with vertex at the origin
of a rectangular coordinate system. Let the initial
line of the angle ‘8’ be along x-axis. Let P(x, y) be

; any point on the terminal side OA of the angle and

Therefore, domain of y= Dy=IR—{x : x €IR and x # (2nm +) Ax # (2nn +), ne Z}.

Hence, Domain of y = Dy= (—©, 09) or IR.
Now, we find the range of (5), since, range of sine function is [—1, 1].
We have -1<sSin3x<1

9.2 Periodicity of Trigonometric Functions
We often encounter periodic phenomenon in the nature, technology, and human society. Recall
the 24-hour day-night cycle, or tidal cycles caused by the moon revolving around the earth.
A periodic function is a function whose value ‘Tepeats after a specific time interval. A periodic
function is represented as ;

f(x +p) = f(x),
Where “P” is the period of the function. For it Sine wave, triangular wave, square wave,
and saw tooth wave are periodic in nature.

Sine wave Square wave
Rectangular wave ’ Saw tooth wave

All trigonometric functions repeat itself at regular intervals, or periods. The values of trigonometric |
functions for ‘@’ and ‘2nz + @’, where @ eR and ne Z, are same. This periodic behavior of

trigonometric functions is called periodicity. ©

Case2:  Putp = 2m in(i)

9.2.2 Periodicity of Tangent Function Ee cos (@ + 2) = cos 0

Suppose “Pp” is the period of Tangent function, then:

tan(@ +p) = tan@ (i) where 6 e€ R.
Now putting @ = 0 in (i), we have:

tan(0 + p) = tan0
= tanp =0
= p =tan~*(0) =0, 7,27, 37, ...
Put p = 7 in (i)

Tan (08 +7) = Tan@ (ii)

From (ii): L.H.S = Tan (w+ 6) = Tan(2 =+6)= Tan@=R.HS
Since terminal side of an angle is in third quadrant, and ‘7’ is the least +ve real number
for which:

Tan(@ +1) = Tan@
‘. 1 is the period of Tan @.

All the trigonometric functions are periodic functions. We can draw their graphs on the intervals
of lengths equal to their periods. Because, when the graph of a periodic function of period ‘p’ is
drawn in a given interval, then it is sufficient to draw its graph only in that.interval. Further, it can
easily be drawn completely by repeating it over the intervals of lengths ‘p’.

Procedure for Sketching Graphs of Sine and Cosine Functions
To graph y =a sin bx aes =acos bx, with b > 0, follow these steps.

Step 1; Find the period = ~, Initially, start from “0” on the x-axis, and lay off a distance of = —,

Step 2: Divide the given ae into four equal parts:
a. Find the midpoint of the given interval by adding the end-points of each interval and
dividing the sum by2.  ~
b. Find the quarter points (the midpoints of the two iaaneils obtained in part (a)).
c. Continue in the same way until the required number of equal parts are obtained.

Step 3: Evaluate the function for each of the five/nine/thirteen x-values resulting from step 2.
The resulting points will be maximum points, minimum points, and x-intercepts.
Step 4: Plot the points obtained in step 3 and join them with a sinusoidal curve having amplitude

jal.
Step 5: Draw the graph over additional periods if required.

9.5 Even and Odd Trigonometric Functions
All functions, including trigonometric functions, can be categorized as even, odd or neither.
e A function is odd if and only if f(—x) = —f(x) and is symmetric (by reflection) with
respect to the origin.
e A function is even if and only if f(—x) = f(x) and is symmetric (by 180° rotation) with
respect to the y-axis.
Key Facts
The graph of Sine function is symmetric about the origin therefore, it is an odd
function.
e The graph of Cosine function is symmetric with respect to y-axis therefore it is an
even function.

Example 8:
Check whether the following function is odd or even?
Solution: f(x) = x*. Sinz... XAG
Replace ‘x’ by ‘—x’
fx) = Cx)". (=z)
—(x)?. C Sin(x))
= x3, Sinx = f(x)

As f(—x) = f(x)

So (i) is an even function.
Example 9:

Check whether the following function is odd or even?
: i= ° se xo. A
(i) y=3 Sinx +4Cosx (ii) b feeedrses 55

Solution:
(i) y =3 Sinx +4Cosx

Replace ‘x’ by ‘—x’
f(-x) = 3Sin (—x) +4 Cos(—x)

--- PAGE 242 ---
= —3 Sinx +4Cosx
= —(3 Sin x — 4Cos x)
As, f(—x)#f(x) or f(—x) #—-f(x)

So, f(x) is neither even nor odd function.

es _ Tanx
(il) ~ x =Sinx
Replace ‘x’ by ‘—x’
— = __Tan (-x) ‘
f ( x) (-x) —Sin (-x)
-Tanx
“=x +Sinx ,
_| Tanx
~ x= Sinx
As, f(—x) = f(x)
So, f (x) is an even function.
