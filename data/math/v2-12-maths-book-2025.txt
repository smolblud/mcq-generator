Preface

This Textbook for Mathematics Grade 12 has been developed by NBF according to
the National Curriculum of Pakistan 2022-2023. The aim of this textbook is to
enhance learning abilities through inculcation of logical thinking in learners, and
to develop higher order thinking processes by systematically building the
foundation of learning from the previous grades. A key emphasis of the present
textbook is creating real life linkage of the concepts and methods introduced.

‘This approach was devised with the intent of enabling students to solve daily life

problems as they grow up in the learning curve and also to fully grasp the
conceptual basis that will be built in subsequent grades.

After amalgamation of the efforts of experts and experienced authors, this book
was reviewed and finalized after extensive reviews by professional educationists.
Efforts were made to make the contents student friendly and to develop the
concepts in interesting ways.

The National Book Foundation is always striving for improvement in the quality of
its textbooks. The present textbook features an improved design, better
illustration and interesting activities relating to real life to make it attractive for
young learners. However, there is always room for improvement, the suggestions
and feedback of students, teachers and the community are most welcome for
further enriching the subsequent editions of this textbook.

_ May Allah guide and help us (Ameen).

Application of Mathematics

Functions and Graphs: Functions represent relationships between variables and
their graphs provide a visual representation of these relationships. They are used
to study trends like profit versus cost in businesses, population growth over time
or changes in speed in physics. Functions help in predicting outcomes and
analyzing real-world data effectively.

Limit, Continuity and Derivative: Limits describe how functions behave near
specific points, continuity ensures smooth graphs without breaks, and derivatives
measure rates of change like speed or growth. These concepts are essential in
physics to calculate instantaneous velocity, in economics for cost optimization
and in biology for population growth modeling.

Integration: Integration helps calculate areas under curves, volumes, or
accumulated quantities. It is widely used to determine total distance from
velocity, analyze energy consumption and compute areas in construction
projects. Integration also has applications in physics, such as finding work done by
a variable force.

Differential Equations: Differential equations describe changes in dynamic
systems, modeling real-world processes like population growth, chemical
reactions and motion. They are used in engineering to design systems, in physics
to describe heat flow or wave motion and in biology to model disease spread.

Kinematics of Motion in a Straight Line: This studies the motion of objects along
a straight path using concepts like displacement, velocity and acceleration.
Applications include calculating stopping distances of vehicles, analyzing free-
fall under gravity and predicting the motion of objects in linear transport
systems.

--- PAGE 5 ---
Analytical Geometry: Analytical geometry combines algebra and geometry to
study the properties of shapes on the coordinate plane. It is used in designing
structures, solving distance and slope problems and planning urban layouts. It
plays a significant role.in architecture and engineering.

Conic Section: Conic sections include circles, ellipses, parabolas, and
hyperbolas, which have various applications. Ellipses describe satellite orbits,
parabolas are used in designing headlights and bridges and hyperbolas are applied
in communication systems and radar design.

Inverse Trigonometric Functions and Their Graphs: Inverse trigonometric

functions calculate angles fromm trigonometric values, essential in navigation,.

surveying, and architecture. Their graphs help solve problems involving slopes,
elevation angles and real-world measurements requiring precision.

Solution of Trigonometric Equations: Trigonometric equations model periodic
phenomena such as sound and light waves. Solving these equations is crucial in
designing musical instruments, analyzing alternating electrical currents and
studying wave patterns in physics and engineering.

Numerical Methods: Numerical methods approximate solutions for complex
problems using algorithms. They are widely used in weather forecasting,
structural analysis of buildings and financial risk modeling. These methods make
it possible to solve equations that are difficult to handle analytically.

Functions have many applications in real life. One is the use of
function in signal processing applications in engineering, including
noise reduction, modulation, and filtering. For example, functions in
audio processing are used to analyze and alter sound waves, which
makes it possible to design devices like equalizers and noise-
canceling headphones. Similar to this, functions are essential to the
encoding, transmitting, and decoding of signals for wireless
communication systems in the telecommunications industry.

1.1 Function

A function f froma set A toa set B assigns to each element of A exactly one element of B. The set A is
called the domain of the function and the set B is called the co-domain of the function.
Mathematically, it is written as f : A > B and is read as f is a function from A to B.

For example, if we are given two sets A = {—1, 1, 2} and B = {1, 4, 9}, f

then f = {(—1, 1), (1, 1), (2, 4)} isa function because each element of the &  ®&
set A is assigned to exactly one element of the set B. i.e. there is no A B :
repetition in the first element of ordered pairs in f. The first element of
each ordered pair in f is called pre-image while its corresponding second ee
element is called image of the first element. For example, in (2, 4), 2 is the ( = 2
pre-image of 4 and 4 is the image of 2.
If x is independent variable and y is dependent variable, then in general, a function f from A to B
is written as f (x) = y.
For example, in the above example,
f(-1) =1,f(1) =1 and f(2)=4.
Explanation: As discussed above, a function relates an input to an output.
For example, if a tree grows 15 cm every year and the height A
of the tree is related to its age as follows:
A(age) = age x 15
then the height of the tree after 10 year is (10) = 10.« 15 = 150 cm
. h(10) = 150’ is like saying 10 is related to 150 or 10 — 150
Here, 10 is the input and 150 is the output of the function.
1.1.1 Domain of a Function

The set of all possible values of independent variable Key Facts

which qualify as inputs to a function is known as the .. fy...

domain of the function. In the above example, . eed Pepe pee '

Domain of function f = Dom f = {—1, 1, 2} Mal function.

How to Find the Domain of a Function i So

To find the domain, we ensure that there is no zero in the denominator of a fraction and no negative

sign inside a square root. In general, the set of all real numbers is considered as the domain of a

function subject to some restrictions. For example:

(i) When the given function is of the form f(x) = 3x + 8 or f(x) = x3 + 2x — 5, the domain
will be “the set of all real numbers”.

(ii) When the given function is of the form f(x) = — > thedomain will be the set of all real numbers
except 2. \

--- PAGE 9 ---
(iii) In some cases, the interval be specified along with the function such as, f(x) = x + 1,
0 <x < 10. Here, x can take the values between 0 and 10 in the domain.

(iv) Domain restrictions refer to the values for which the given function cannot be defined.

1.1.2 Range of a Function

The set of all the outputs of a function is known as the range of the function or after substituting the
domain, the entire set of all possible values as outcomes of the dependent variable.

Ina function y = f (x), the spread ofall the values y from minimum to maximum is the range of the
et function. In the above example,

Range of function f = Rang f = {1,4}
How to Find the Range of a Function

* Substitute all the values of x in the function to check whether it is positive, negative or equal to
other values. Eliminate the values ofx for which the function is not defined.

¢. Find the minimum and maximum values for y.
1.1.3 Codomain ofa Function
The codomain is the set of all possible outcomes of the given function.
In general, the range is the subset of the codomain. But sometimes the codomain is also equal to the
range of the function. In above example,
Codomain of function f = {1, 4,9}
In short:
>» Whatcan go into a function is called the domain.
>» What may possibly come out ofa function is called the codomain.
>» Whatactually comes out ofa function is called the range.
In the adjoining figure,

; ¢ Theset {a,b,c} isthe domain.

> * Theset {1,2,3,4, 5} isthe codomain.

¢ Theset {1,2,3} istherange.
Example 1; Find the domain and range of a function f(x) = 2x? — 4.

Solution: f(x) = 2x? —4 i errr Key Facts
The given function has no undefined values of x. A function is like a machine that
Thus, the domain is the set of all real numbers. yas takes an input and produces a

If we put x = 0 in the given function, we get f(x) = —4. example, the distance a car has
For all real values of x, other than 0, we get an output traveled (the output) is dependent
greeter than —4. on how long that car has been

driving (the input).

Hence, the range of f(x) is [—4, 00).

Example 2:

Find the domain and range of function g(x) = vx — 3.

Solution: g(x) = vx -—3

The given function is defined for all real numbers x greater than or equal to 3.
Thus, the domain of g(x) is [3, 0).

If we put x = 3 in the given function, we get g(3) = 0.

For all real values of x, greater than 3, we get an output greater than 0.
Hence, the range of g(x) is [0, 0).

1.2 Types of Functions
1.2.1 Into Function AmB
A function f: A — B is said to be into function if there exists at least one
element or more than ong element in B, which does not have any pre- || |
images in A, which simply means that every clement of the codomain is ascend
not mapped with elements of the domain. i.e., range (f) # B.
In the adjoining diagram, f = {(a, 1), (b, 3), (c, 3)} is an into function.
Some examples of into functions are:
¢ f(x) =sinx where f: R > R is into function because it doesn’t cover all values in
the interval R.
© g(x) =x? where g: R > R is into function because it doesn’t map to any negative real
numbers. -
© h(x) = e* where h: R — [0,09) is into function because it doesn’t map to zero.
1.2.2 Onto (Surjective) Function

For any two non-empty scts A and B, a function f : A > B will be onto if a
every element of set B is an image of some clement of set A. i.c., forevery = A B

y © B there exists an element .x in A such that f(x) — y which implies
rang(f) = B. _

In the adjoining diagram, f = {(a, 2), (b, 1), (c, 3)} is an onto function, ee!

Some examples of onto functions are:

e f(x)=x — (Identity function) .

© g(x)=e* when g: R--R” (Exponential function)
_ © h(x)=x* (Square function)

e m(x) =x? (Cubic function)

* p(x)=c (Constant function)

1.2.3 One to One (Injective) Function f
For any two non-empty sets A and B, a function f: A > B will be one-to-one * i
if distinct elements of set A have distinct images in set B. In the adjoining

diagram, f = {(a, 2), (b, 1), (c, 3)} is a one-to-one function. mae
A function f: A — B is one-to-one if f (x1) = f (x2) implies x1 = x2.

i.e., an image of a distinct element of A under f mapping (function) is distinct.

Some examples of one-one functions are:

e f(x)=x (Identity function)

—@ g(x) = 2x +3 (Linear function)

e h(x) =e* (Exponential function)

e m(x) = VX (Square root function, defined for x > 0)

1.2.4 Injective Function

A function which is both into and one-one is called an injective function.
1.2.5 Bijective Function

A function which is both onto and one-one is called a bijective function.

Bijective function shows one-one correspondence between the elements of two sets.

Example 3: Check whether the function f(x) = 2x + 3, is one-to-one or not if
domain = {0.5, 1,2} and codomain = {4, 5, 7}
Solution: Putting 1, 2 and 0.5 in f(x) = 2x + 3, we get f(0.5) = 4, f(1) =5 and f(2) =7
As, for every value of x, we get a unique f(x) thus, the function f(x) is one to one. ,
Example 4: Check whether the function is one-to-one or not: f(x) = 2x? + 1.
Solution: To check whether the function is one to one or not, let:

f(%) = f(z)

2(x,)? +1 = 2(x,)* +1

(x1)* = (x2)?

Since (x,)* = (x2)? is not always true, therefore the function is not one to one function.

‘Solution: Given f(x) = x? — 1 with Dom f(x) = {1,—1,2, —2} and Codom f(x) = {0,3, —3)
Substituting the elements of the domain in the function, we get:

f(-2) = (-2)? - o |
Therefore, Rang f(x) = {0,3}. As, Rang f(x) = = 5 + {0, 3, -3) = Codom f (x).
So, the given function is an into function. -
Example 6: Find the type of the function f(x) = 3x + 2 defined on f: R > R.
Solution: Let, f(x) =yo> y=3x+2 > y-2=3x = ent
Substituting the value of x in the given function f(x), we get: ‘
fa) =6(CS =3(%*)+2=y-2+2=y

Since, we get back y after putting the value of x in the function. Hence the given function is an
onto function.

1.3 Inverse Function

The inverse of any function f(x) is a function denoted by f~*(x) which reverses the effect of
f(x) and it undoes what f(x) does. In mathematics, the inverse function is also denoted by f~*.
If f: XY, then f~?: Y > X. ie., If the application of a function f to x as input gives an output
of y, then the application of inverse function f~* to y should give back the value of x.

It can be illustrated in the following diagram as:

From the above diagram:
dom f=rang f~? and rang f = dom f~*
i.e., The domain of the given function becomes the range of the inyers¢ function, and the range of
the given function becomes the domain of the inverse function.

Note that f~? is not the reciprocal of f and not every function has an inverse. If a function FR)
has an inverse, then f(x) never takes the same value twice. In simple words, the inverse function
exists only when f is both one-one and onto function. Can we say that the inverse function is also
a bijective function?

Moreover, the composition of the function f and the inverse function f~! gives .the domain

value of x.

‘ 1.4 Linear, Quadratic and Square Root Functions
ee 1.4.1 Linear Function
The function of the form,
y=ax+biabeRaat0

is called linear. It is a polynomial function

of degree one.

For example, f(x) = x + 2, g(x) = 2x-1

are linear functions.

The graph ofa linear function is a straight

line and the slope of any two points on the |

line is the same. The domain and range of

the linear function is R.

1.4.2 Non-linear Function :

A function that is not linear is called a non-linear function. A nonlinear function is a function whose

plotted graph form a curved line. For example, quadratic function, cubic function, square root

function and exponential function etc. The slope of every two points on the graph of non-linear is not

the same. Let us recall the shapes of the graphs of ene and square root functions here.

(a) Quadratic Function

The function is of the form,

| y =ax*?+bx+c:a,b,ceRaat0
is called quadratic.
It is a polynomial function of degree two.
For example, f(x) = x* + 3x —2 and
g(x) = 5 — 2x? are quadratic functions.
The domain and range of the quadratic
function is R. The graph of a quadratic
equation is U-shaped and is parabolic in
nature.

1.5.3 Graph of Quadratic Function

We know that the polynomial function of degree two is called a quadratic function. This function is
of the form:

f(x) =ax? + bx +c;a,b,ceRanda+#0
The graph of the quadratic equation is a parabola.
For example, y = x? + 2x +1 and y = 2— 3x? are quadratic functions.
Understanding the Graph
e a: The coefficient a, affects the direction and width of the parabola. If a > 0, the parabola opens

upwards. If a < 0, the parabola opens downwards. The larger the absolute value of a, the
narrower the parabola.

¢ b: This coefficient affects the position of the vertex horizontally (left or right) and slope of the
parabola at the vertex.
ec: = is the y-intercept. So, the point (0, c) is on the parabola.

e y=-= -- is equation of axis of symmetry and is also the x-coordinate of the vertex.

1.6 Drawing Graph Using Factors

Let us draw the graph of quadratic function using factors.

We know that y = ax’ + bx + cis a quadratic function where a # 0 and the graph of sucha function is

a parabola. These graphs can be tricky to sketch manually, but factoring the quadratie gives us all of

the information we need to do so successfully.

Procedure:

The points where any parabola intersects the x-axis will be the solutions to the equation:
ar+bx+c=0 (i)

Now if we can factor equation (i) in the format:

y-axis

(0, 4)

(x—x1)(x—x2) = 0.
then by the zero product property, we get:

xX=xX, and x=x,

--- PAGE 20 ---
| TRE UNIT-01: FUNCTIONS AND GRAPHS

‘This means that x, and x, are the x-intercepts. In other words, graph will intersect x-axis at (x,, 0) and
(x,, 0). The constant c tells us what the y-intercept will be. More specifically, the constant term c
places the y-intercept at (0, c), giving us a third specific point on y-axis. Likewise, the value of a tells
us whether our parabola will open up or down. If a is positive, the parabola opens upward. If it is
negative, the parabola opens downward.

We canalso figure out the vertex of the parabola by factoring the quadratic equation.

The x-coordinate of the vertex ofa parabola is the arithmetic mean of two x-intercepts = at | nee,
ma

Once we have the x-coordinate, we can determine the y-coordinate by plugging the x value into the
given function and solving for y. With these four specific points including both x-intercepts,
y-intercept and the vertex of the parabola, we can create an accurate sketch of the graph quickly and
easily.
Example 10: Draw the graph of y = x* — 8x + 12 using factors.
Solution:
Given function is: y = x? — 8x + 12 srt |
To get x-intercepts, put x* —8x + 12 = 0
After factorization, we get:
x1 = 2, x2= 6

=> The graph intersects x-axis at (2, 0) and (6, 0).
To find y-intercept, put x = 0 in the given function
which gives y = 12.
Therefore y-intercept is (0, 12).

xitx2 _ 2+6 _ 4

Vertex: x-coordinate of vertex = > = >
Substituting, x = 4 in given function, we get:
y-coordinate of vertex = 4 — 8(4) + 12 = —4

”. Vertex = (4, —4)
As a=1> 0, therefore parabola opens upward.

The graph is symmetri¢ about x = 4. The sketch of the graph is shown in the figure.

Given function is: y = —x* + 4x —4
To get x-intercepts, put:

After factorization, we get repeated roots:
X,=2, x2=2
This shows that the graph intersects x-axis at (2, 0),
which is the vertex of the parabola.
To find y--intercept, put x = 0 in the given function
which gives y = —4.

Slope of the line is:

Equation of the line is:

y=x-2
Which is the required function.

Example 13: Predict function from the graph.
Solution:

The graph shows a parabola passing through points
(2,0) and (—1, 0) and (0, —4). We know that the
equation of the parabola is quadratic.

Now, the equation of the parabola passing through
(p, 0) and (q,0) is of the form:

y = a(x — p)(x — q) where p = 2,q = —1 and

a > 0 as the parabola opens upwards.

Substituting the values of p and q in the above
equation, we get:

y = a(x —2)(x + 1) (i)

Since the parabola passes through (0, —4), therefore

1.8. Graph of Modulus Functions
A modulus function (absolute valued function) determines a number's magnitude regardless of its
sign. Ifx is areal number, then ve modulus function is denoted by:
=|x| or f(x) = |x| wherex ER.

The modulus function takes ri actual value of x if it is more than or equal to 0 and the function takes
the minus of the actual value x ifit is less than 0.
1.8.1 Domain and Range of Modulus Function
The domain of modulus function is R while its range is the set of non-negative real numbers, denoted
as [0, co). Any real number can be modulated using the modulus function.
Example: Consider the modulus function f(x) = |x|. Then:

« Ifx=—S,theny = f(x) = —(—5) = 5, since x is less than zero.

¢ Ifx=6, then y = f(x) =6, since x is greater than zero.

e Ifx=0,then y= f(x) =0, since x is equal to zero.
1.8.2 Graph of Modulus Function
Consider the modulus function f(x) = |x|
Table shows the values of f(x) below:

[x [-3[-2[-1]0]1;2]3_
fed] 3 | 2 [1] 0] 1 [eye |
It can be inferred that for all possible values of x,
the function f(x) remains positive.

1.10.1 Algebraic Function
An algebraic function is a function that involves only algebraic operations. These arenes include
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
Types of Algebraic Functions
Main types of algebraic functions are:
(i) Polynomial Functions
A function of the from p(x) = a,x" + dp_x"-? +++ a,x +a@9 where do, a4, .., Qn are
’ constants and n is integer, is called a polynomial function. Some examples are:

© f(x) =x*° —7x +3 (quintic function)
(ii) Rational Functions
A function that is composed of two functions and expressed in the form of a fraction is a rational
function. If f(x) is a rational function, then f(x) = P(x)/q(x), where p(x) and g(x) are

(iii) Power Functions

The power functions are of the form f(x) = k x* where'k' and'a' are any real numbers. Since ‘a’ is a

real number, the exponent can be either an integer or a rational oumber.

Some examples are: :

f(x) = x*, f(x) = = (reciprocal function) and f(x) = Vx — 2 = (x — 2)2

Properties

* Algebraic functions are closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and
composition.

.* Algebraic functions are easy to solve, differentiate and integrate.

Application

* Physics and Engineering: Simple mechanical system, the motion of objects under constant
acceleration.

* Geometry: Many curyes suchas circles and ellipses.

1.10.2 Transcendental Functions

The functions which are not algebraic are called transcendental. These functions can only be

expressed in terms of infinite series. Some examples are:

¢ Exponential functions: f(x) = e*, g(x) = a3*

¢ Logarithmic functions: f(x) = logax, g(x) = Inx; where base a is a positive constant.

* Trigonometric functions: f(x) = sinx, g(x) = cosx, h(x) = tanx

* Inverse trigonometric functions: f(x) = sin='x, g(x) = cos~4x

¢ Hyperbolic functions: f(x) = sinhx, g(x) = coshx, h(x) = tanhx

* Inverse hyperbolic functions: f(x) = sinh~1x, g(x) = cosh71x

* Special functions: Bessel functions, Gamma functions, error functions etc.

Properties

* These functions are not expressible in terms of a finite Saitnation of algebraic operation of
addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, raising to a power and extracting a root.

* These functions often exhibit more complex behavior like periodicity (in the case of
trigonometric functions) and rapid growth (in the case of exponential function).

Application

* Science and Engineering: Exponential and logarithmic functions are critical in modelling
growth, decay and oscillation in natural systems.

* Signal processing: Trigonometric functions are fundamental in analysing waves, sounds and
signals.

involve transcendental functions,

1.10.3 Logarithmic Functions

Logarithmic functions form a fundamental class of transcendental functions. These functions are

inverse of exponential functions. They play a crucial role in mathematics, science, engineering and
many applied fields.

--- PAGE 27 ---
UNIT-01: FUNCTIONS AND GRAPHS 93>

Definition: If you have an exponential function of the form y = a* where a > 0 and a ¥ 1, then

the logarithmic function is defined as:
x = logaW)
Replacing y with x, we have:
y = loga(x)
Here, log, (x) is read as logarithmic of x to the base a.
Base of the Logarithms
The base of logarithm determines its specific type. Some types are:
: e Natural logarithm: It is written as log.(x) = Inx where e = 2.71828... is called

¢ Common logarithm: It is written as log,9(x) where a = 10.
¢ Binary logarithm: It is written as log, (x) where a = 2.
Properties ,
+ The logarithm is the inverse of exponential. If y = a*, then x = loga(y). °
This means log,(a*) = x and a!°ta) = y,
e The domain of log,(x) is x > 0 because we cannot take the logarithm of zero or a
negative real number. :
Laws of Logarithms
e Product Rule: loga(xy) = logg(x) + loga(y)
¢ Quotient Rule: log, ) = loga(x) — loga(y)
¢ Power Rule: log,(x") = n log,(x)
« Change of Base Rule: For any positive bases a # 1 and b # 1:

loga(x) = cas

Note: As a* = 1, therefore log,(1) = 0.

Graph of Exponential Function
* Ifthe base, a is greater than 1, then the function increases
: exponentially at a. growth rate of a. This is known as

* Ifthe base, a is less than 1 (but greater than 0) the function
decreases exponentially at a rate of a. This is known as
exponential decay.

* If the base, a is equal to 1, then the function trivially
becomes y = 1. This means exponential function always
passes through (0, 1).

* The points (0, 1)and (1, a) are always on the graph of the function y = a*.

* Exponential function takes only positive values and its graph never touches x-axis.

* The domain of the exponential function is the set of all real numbers, whereas the range of this
function is the set of positive real numbers.

Conclusions

Logarithmic functions are powerful tools for dealing with exponential growth and decay as well as

for measuring and comparing quantities on vastly different scales. Their unique properties and

applications make them essential in both theoretical and applied fields. Most of the applications, we

find, are in the fields of engineering and computer technology.

Example 20: Suppose that Rs. 30,000 is invested at 8% interest compounded annually. In t years,

it will grow to the amount A(t) given by the function: A(t) = 30,000 (1.08)°

(i) How long will it take until then is Rs. 150,000 in the account?

(ii) Let T be the amount of tinte it takes for the Rs.30,000 to double itself. Find T.

Solution:

(i) We set A(t) = 150,000 and solve for t.
150,000 = 30,000 (1.08)' = (1.08)' =

Taking natural log on both sides, we get:

In(1.08)* =InS5 => tin(1.08) = In5
Ins 1.6094

“Fr In(1.08) 7 0.07696 ~ 20:2

Therefore, it will take almost 20.9 years for Rs. 30,000 to grow to Rs. 150,000.
(ii) To find the doubling time T, we set A(t) = Rs. 60,000, t = T and solve for T.

60,000 = 30,000 (1.08)" = (1.08)' = 2° = 2
Taking natural log on both sides, we get: y,
In(1.08)' =In2_ => T In(1:08) = In2
In2 0.6931 ~
= = ——— 29
In(1.08) 0.07696

Therefore, doubling time is about 9 years.

1.11 Domain and Range of Transcendental Functions through Graphs
If a weight is attached to a spring and the
weight is pushed up or pulled down and
released, it tends to rise and fall alternately.
The weight is said to be oscillating in
harmonic motion. If the position of the
weight y is graphed over time the result is the
graph ofa sine or cosine curve.

1.11.1 Graph of y =sin@ and y = cos@

To graph the sine or cosine function, we use the horizontal axis for the values of @ expressed in
either degrees or radians and vertical axis for the values of sin@ or cos@. Ordered pairs for these
points are of the form (@, sin@) or (8, cos@).

1.11.4 Inverse Trigonometric Functions

Inverse trigonometric functions, also known as arc functions or anti-trigonometric functions,
are the inverse functions of the standard trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent,
secant, and cosecant). They are used to find the angle when the trigonometric ratio is known. For

example, arcsin(x) finds the angle whose sine is x.

1.12 Relation Between a 1-1 Function and its Inverse through Graphs
1.12.1 One-One Function and its Graph ;

One to one function is a special function that maps every clement of the range to exactly one element
of its domain i.c., the outputs never repeat.
Examples: (i) The function f(x) = x — 3 is a one-to-one function since it produces a different
answer for every input. vy,
(ii) The function g(x) = x* — 1 is not a one-to-one function since it produces one output 0 -

for the two inputs | and —1.

--- PAGE 34 ---
1.12.2 Horizontal Line Test .

The horizontal line test is used to determine whether a function is one-one when its graph is given. To

test whether the function is one-one from its graph just take a horizontal line (consider a horizontal

stick) and make it pass through the graph.

* Ifthe horizontal line does not pass through more than one point of the graph, then the function is
one-one.

¢ Ifthe horizontal line passes through more than one point of the graph, then the function is not one-one.

Examples: If we draw horizontal lines on the above graphs, we observe that:

(i) The graph of f(x) = x — 3 passes horizontal line test, so it is ono-one function.

(ii) The graph of g(x) = x? — 1 fails horizontal line test, so it is not ono-one function.

Horizontal line

f (x) is one-one function. g(x) is not a one-one function.

By using horizontal line test, check whether the function y =x is 1-1 function or not.

1.123 Inverse of One-One Function
Suppose f: X — Y is a one-one function. Since every element y of Y corresponds with precisely
one element x of X, the function f must determines a “reverse function” g: Y ~ X
whose domain is Y and range is X. Then f and g imply that:
fx)=y and g(y)=x f
— f@O)=y and gf(%))=x —
he function g is given the formal name as “inverse of f”.
From the above discussion it is clear that: ‘
Dom f = Rang g and Rang f = Dom g XSF
Let f be a one-to-one function with domain X and range Y. The inverse of f is a function g with
domain Y and range X for which:
f(g(y)) = y foreveryyinY and g(f(x)) =x foreveryx in X.
Symbolically the inverse of a function f is denoted by f~*. Thus, g(x) = f~*(x). It is to be noted
that, (x) is not the same as [f(x)]~1. In terms of this new notation, we have:

f(f-*(@x)).= fF @)) =x

1.12.4 Properties of the Inverse of One to One Function

| Here are the properties of the inverse of one to one function:

e The function f has an inverse function if and only if f is a one to one function.

e Ifthe functions f and g are inverses of each other then, both these functions are one to one.

*  f and g are inverses of each other if and only if f(g(x)) = x,x in the domain of g and
g (f(x)) =x, x in the domain of f.

e If /f and g are inverses of each other then the domain of f is equal to the range of g and the
range of g is equal to the domain of f.

| ; ¢ If f and g are inverses of each other then their graphs will make reflections of each other on
‘the line y = x.

| ° Ifthe point (a, b) is on the graph of os then meine (b, a) is on the graph of f~}.

Example 22: Find the i inverse of ee (x) = = :* #3 , then represent f and f~? graphically.
Solution: Given that f (x) = —o
Since f is a one to one function, therefore:

Graph of function f(x) and f~1(x) are al in the adjoining figure. From the graph it is clear
that if any point (@, b) is on the graph of f(x) then point (b,a) is on the graph of f~*(x).

Challenge: Can you find inverse of f (x) given in example 23, by any other method?
Example 23: Given that f(x) = 3 — 4x is one to one. Find (3) inverse and represent f and f~1

graphically.

‘ Solution: Given that f(x) = 23— 4x or y=3-—4x
Solving for x, we get:
> 4x=3-y => x= ora

= f(y) =

=> f(x) === [Replacing y with x.]
Graph of function f(x) and f~!(x) are shown
in the adjoining figure. From the graph it is

clear that the point (3, 0) is on the graph of f (x)
and the point (0, 3) is on the graph of f~1(x).
Therefore, both the graphs are reflections of each other.

1.13 Transformation of a Graph through Vertical Shift, Horizontal Shift
and Scaling
1.13.1 Vertical and Horizontal Shift

Ashiftis a rigid translation as it does notchange the shape or size of the graph of the function. A shift
only changes the location of the graph.

Vertical Shift: A vertical shift adds/subtracts a positive constant to/from every y-coordinate while
leaving the x-coordinate unchanged.

Horizontal Shift: A horizontal shift adds/subtracts a positive constant to/from every x-coordinate
while leaving the y-coordinate unchanged.

Vertical and horizontal shifts can be combined into one expression.

iF

< Shifts are added/subtracted to the x or f(x) components. If the positive constant is grouped
with the x, then it is a horizontal shift, otherwise it is a vertical shift.

In this section, we will discuss the geometric effects on the graph of y = f(x) by adding or
subtracting a positive constant c to f or to its independent variable x.
The summary of vertical and horizontal shift is elaborated in the table 1.1 below.

1.13.2 Scaling (Stretching/Compressing)

Scaling is a non-rigid translation in which the shape and size of the graph of the function is altered. A
scale will multiply/divide coordinates and this will change the appearance as well as the location.
Vertical Scaling: A vertical scaling multiplies/divides every y-coordinate by a constant while
leaving the x-coordinate unchanged.

Horizontal Scaling: A horizontal scaling multiplies/divides every x-coordinate by a constant while
leaving the y-coordinate unchanged.

Note: The vertical and horizontal scaling can be combined into one expression.

In this section, we will discuss the geometric effects on the graph of y = f(x) by multiplying or
dividing with a positive constant c to f or to its independent variable x.

The summary of vertical-and horizontal scaling is elaborated in the tables 1.2 and 1.3 below.

T-02: LIMIT, CONTINUITY AND DERTIVATI

2.1 Limits of Functions

Two of the most fundamental concepts in the study of calculus are the notions of function and the
limit of the function. In this first section, we shall be especially interested in determining whether the
values f(x) ofa function f approach a fixed number L as x approaches a number'a' using the symbol

‘~»' forthe word 'approach' we ask f(x) > L as x >a.
2.1.1 Limit ofa Function i tin toa Number

Consider a function: . I(x%)=

Whose domain is set of all real numbers lean —4. Although /(—4) is not defined, nonetheless,

f(x) can be calculated for any value of x near —4. The table shows that, as x approaches to —4

from either the left or right, the functional values f(x) approaches to 8. That is, when x is

near —4, f(x) is near 8. We say 8 is the limit of f(x) as x approaches to —4. We can write as:
16-x°

: —8 — —4 or lim ——— =8
F(x) as x or lim atx

aes Cae

Forx +—4, f can be simplified by cancellation f(x) = 16=x' (4+xK4—%)

4+x 4+x
The graph of / is essentially the graph of y = 4-.x with the exception that the graph of / has a
hole at the point that corresponds to x = —4. As x get closer and closer to - 4, represented by the
two arrowheads on the x-axis, The two arrowheads on the y-axis simultaneously get closer and
closer to the number 8.

=4-x.

Intuitive Definition: If f(x) can be made arbitrarily closer to a finite number by taking ; = iciently
i close to but different from a numbera, from both the left and right side of a, then tiny f(x) =

: x -+a™ denote that x approaches a from the left and x ~ a* denote that x ‘cieiiabané from the right.
Thus, if both sides have the common value L,
: im f= im f(x) =
We say that: lim f (x) exist and write lim f@=L ;
} Note: The existence of a limit of a function fata does not depend on whether fis actually defined for
a but only on whether fis defined for neara.

2.2 Continuity

| In the case of limit, we have used the bis “connect the violate with smooth curve”. The phrase
provides the concept of graph that is a nice continuous curve that is, a curve with no gaps or breaks.
Indeed, a continuous function is often described as one whose graph can be drawn without lifting
pencil from paper.
Before moving towards the precise definition of continuity, we demonstrate in aga some intuitive
examples of functions that are not continuous or continuous at a number.

is discontinuous at | since f(1) is not define.
From graph, we observe that limf (x) = 3. We can
also state that f is continuous at any other number x # 1.

Example 6: Given figure shows the graph of the piecewise function defined

Since lim f(x) # f(2) = 5, therefore f is discontinuous at 2.

Example 7: Let f(x) = oe for x + 2. Show how to define f(2) in order to make f

2.2.2, Continuity on an Interval

A function is said to be continuous on an open servi (a, ) if it is continuous at every number in the
interval. A function fis continuous on a Closed interval [a, 4] if it is continuous on (a, 5) and in
addition, it is continuous on [a, 5)

jim  f wid f(a) and Jim nf (x) = f(b)
Example 8:

a f(x)= a is continuous on the open interval (—1, 1)
but is not continuous on the closed interval [—1, 1],
since neither f(—1) nor f (1) is defined.

b. f(x) = V1 —x? is continuous on [—1, 1] we can observe from
figure that lim, f(x) = f(—1) = 0 and lim f(x) = f(1) = 0

c. f(x) = ¥x—1 is continuous on [1, 0) since

| 2.3 Rate of Change of Functions

. 2.3.1 Tangent of a Graph .
Suppose y = f(x) is a continuous function. In the figure(i), the graph of f possesses a tangent line

: L at a point P, and then we would like to find its equation.

To do so we need: (i) the coordinates of P and

(ii) the slope mean of L.
The coordinates of P pose no difficulty since a point on
a P/ Tangent line L at P
a graph is obtained by specifying a value of x,
say x = a in domain of f. The coordinates of point of .
tangency are (a, f (a)). Fig (i)

As a means of approximating the slope man, we find the slope of secant lines that pass through
the fixed-point P and any other point Q on the graph,

If P has coordinates (a, f(a)) and if we let Q have coordinates (a + Ax, f (a + Ax)), then from
fig (ii) the slope of the secant line through P and Q is Y

Ay = f(a+hx)- f(a)

Then, Mec = x

When the value of Ax is close to zero either positive
or negative, we get points Q and Q’ on the graph on |
each side of P, but close to the point P, we expect that
the slopes Mpg and Mpg, are very close to the slope
of the tangent line L. See fig (iii)

--- PAGE 52 ---
Definition: Tangent line

Let y = f (x) be a continuous function. At a point (a, f(a)) the tangent line to the graph is the line
that passes through the point with slope.

2.5.2 Rate of Change
The slope = of a secant through (a, f (a)) is also called the average rate of change of f at a. The
slope mya = lim < is said to be the instantaneous rate of change of the functions at a, if man = =

at a point (a, f(a) ), we would not expect the values of f to change drastically for x values near a.

Remark: The line L is tangent at P but intersects the

graph of f at three points. but is not tangent to the graph.

2.4 Instantaneous Velocity

Almost everyone has an intuitive notion of speed or velocity as a rate at which a distance is covered

in a certain length of time. When, say, a bus travels 60 miles in one hour, the average velocity of the

bus must have been 60 mil/hr. Of course, it is difficult to maintain the rate of 60 mil/hr for the entire

trip because the bus slow down for towns and speeds up when it passes cars. In other words, the

4 velocity changes with time. If a bus company's schedule demands that the bus travel the 60 miles

°* from one town to another in one hour, the driver knows instinctively that he must compensate for

, velocities or speeds below 60 mil/hr by travelling at speeds greater than this at other points in

journey. Knowing that the average velocity is 60 mil/hr doesn't, however, answer the questions, what
is the velocity of the bus at a particular instant?

distance travelled

Average velocity: Vave = eager wear

Consider a runner who finishes a 10 km race in an elapsed time of 1 hour and 15 min (1.25 hr). The

But suppose we now wish to determine velocity at the instant the runner is one half hour into the race.

Example 18: Find 2 » if y = (4x? — 1)(7x? + x).

Solution: We can use two methods to find = . We can either use the product rule or we can
multiply out the factors in y and then differentiate. We provide both methods.

2.8 The Connection Between Derivatives and Continuity

* Ifa function is differentiable ata point, itis automatically continuous at that point.

* But the reverse is not always true. A function can be continuous at a point and still not be
differentiable (like a sharp comer or cusp, for example | x | is continuous but not differentiable).

2.9 Derivations of Trigonometric Functions

The main objective of this section is to obtain formulas for the derivatives of six basic
trigonometric functions. We will assume in this section that the variable x in the trigonometric
functions sinx, cosx, tanx, cotx, secx and cosecx is measured in radians. We also need the limits
in results and restated as follows:

2.12 Implicit Differentiation
2.12.1 Explicit and Implicit Functions

A function in which the dependent variable is expressed solely in terms of the independent variable
x, namely y=/(x) is said to be an explicit function, for example, y = <x3 — 1 isanexplicit function,
whereas an equivalent equation 3y — x? — 4 = 0 is said to define the function implicitly or y is an
implicit of x. , ‘

2.12.2 Explicit Differentiation

One way to find a is to rewrite this equation as:

Example 37: a) Find Ay and dy for y = Sx? + 4x +1

Since dx = Ax. We observe that
-Ay = (10x + 4)Ax + 5(Ax)? and
dy = (10x + 4)Ax differ by the amount 5(Ax)?.

2.16 Approximations

When Ax = 0, differentials give a means of “predicting” the value of f(x + Ax) by knowing the
value of the function and its derivative at x. From fig if x is changes by an amount 4x, then the

--- PAGE 71 ---
————eeESeEEOEEEEE——————S

corresponding change in the function is

Ay = f(x + Ax) — f(x) and so

f(x + Ax) = f(x) + Ay

For small change in x, take Ay = dy

f(x + Ax) = f(x) + dy

= f(x) + f'(x)dx

Example 38: Find the approximated value of ¥25.4.
Solution: First, identify the function f(x) = Vx

2.17.1 The Second Derivative

The derivative f’(x) is a function derived from a function y = f(x). By differentiating the first
derivative f'(x), we obtain another function called the second derivative, which is denoted by
f''(x). In terms of the operation symbol * we define the second derivative with respect to xas the
function obtained by differentiating y = f(x) twice is successive.

The second derivative is commonly denoted by

Suppose a function f is defined on an interval I. The maximum and minimum values of f on I (if
exist) are said to be extrema of the functions. We have two kinds of extrema.

However, suppose we focus our attention on values

ofx that are close to, or ina neighborhood of the
numbers c, and c,.

As shown in fig(b), f(c,) is the maximum value of the
function in the interval (a,, 6,) and f(c,) is a minimum

value in the interval (a,, b,). These local or relative,
extrema are defined as follows:

then either f'(c) = 0 or f'(c) does not exist.

Critical values: A critical value of a function f is a number in c in its domain for which
f'(c) = 0 or f'(c) does not exist.

2.22 Applications of Derivatives

Many real world phenomenon involve changing quantities like the speed of the rocket, the inflation
of currency, the number in a bacteria in a culture, the stoke intensity ofan earth quake, the voltage of
an electrical signal and so forth. In this section we will develop the concept of limits, continuity,
derivative and extrema of function for use in real world problems. Another important application of
the derivative is to find solution of the optimization problems. For example, if time is the main
consideration in a problem, we might be interested in finding the quickest way to perform a task and
if cost is the main consideration we might be interested in finding the least expensive way to perform
a task. Mathematically, optimization problem can be reduced to finding the largest or smallest value
of a function on some interval and determining where the largest and smallest values occurs. Using
derivatives, we will develop the mathematical tools necessary for solving such problems.

Example 49: A side of a cube is measured to be 30cm with the possible error of +0.02cm . What
is the approximate maximum possible error in the volume of the cube?

Solution: The volume of a cube is V = x3, where x the length of one side. If Ax represents the
error in the length of one side, then the corresponding error in the volume is:

AV = (x + Ax)? — x?

We use differential: dv = 3x*dx = 3x7Ax

as an approximate to AV. Thus, for x = 30 and Ax = +0.02, the approximate maximum error is:
dv = 3(30)?(+0.02) = +54cm?

Example 50: Asquare is expanding with time. What is the rate at which the area increases related
to the rate at which a side increases?

Example 52: Find two non-negative numbers whose sum is 15 such that the product of one with the

that: ~ x+y =15.......@
Let p denote the product: p= x.y? (Product = one number. square of the other)

The function p(x) defined any for 0 < x < 15.
Ifx > 15, then y = 15 — x would be negative.

p'(x) = x.2(15 ~x)(-—1) + (145 — x)? = (15 - ~aUus— 3x)
Thus, any critical value i isx = 5.
Testing the end points of the interval reveal p(0) = p(15) = 0, is the minimum value of the

INTEGRATION

After studying this unit, students will be able to:

There is a lot of applications of integration in various fields. For
example, we use definite integrals to calculate the force exerted on
the dam when the reservoir is full and we examine how changing
water levels affect that force. Hydrostatic force is only one of the
many applications of definite integrals. From geometric
applications such as surface area and volume, to physical
applications such as mass and work, to growth and decay models,
definite integrals are a powerful tool to help us understand and
model the world around us. A view of Tarbela dam is shown below.

‘3.1 Integration

This unit examines the process by which we determine functions from their derivatives. We are

already familiar with inverse operations. For example, addition and subtraction are inverse of each

other. Similarly, multiplication and division are inverse of each other. In the same way, the inverse
operation of differentiation is anti-differentiation or integration.

This unit provides two processes and their relationship to one another. One step is to find function

from their derivatives. In the second step, we can determine things like area and volume through
successive approximations. This process is called integration. This is very important area in é
mathematics and was discovered independently by Leibnitz and Newton.

The process of finding a function from one of its known values and its derivative f(x) has two steps:

The first is to find a formula that gives us all the functions that could possibly have f(x) as a
derivative. If f’(x) is defined as derivative, then f(x) is called anti-derivative and the formula that
gives them all is called the indefinite integral of f (x). The reverse process of derivative or anti-
differentiation is the main topic of this unit.

Definition 3.1:
A function F'(x) is called an anti-derivative of another function f(x) if:
F(x) = f(@)
For example:
14 1 4 at. 1.4 :
7x 7* +3, qe +e (c is any constant.)

are anti-derivatives of x’ since the derivative ofeach is’.
Above example shows that a function can have many anti-derivatives. In fact, if F(x) is any anti-
derivative of f(x) and cis any constant, then F(x) + c is also an anti-derivative of f(x) since:
= (F(x) + c] = S[F@)] + lel = f@) + 0= f@)

Therefore, if F(x) is any anti-derivative of f(x) on a given interval, then for any value of c, the
function F(x) + c is also an anti-derivative of /(x) on that interval.
Symbolically we write:

J f@)dx = F(x) +c ‘

Where the symbol, “f” is called ‘integral sign’ and f(x) is called integrand. The symbol dx indicates
that the integration is performed with respect to the variable x. The arbitrary constant c is called

‘constant of integration’.

3.3 Integration by Substitution ‘

There are many functions that cannot be integrated by simple techniques and can be integrated easily
by using method of substitution. It is an integration technique which involves making a substitution
to,simplify the integral. In this method any given integral is transformed into a simple form of
integral by substituting the independent variable by others. The exact substitution depends on the
form of the given integral, as some substitutions are more appropriate for certain problems than
others. The choice of substitution is not always immediately obvious. The ability to recognise an
appropriate substitution comes from practising many different examples.

Mostly, we substitute trigonometric functions in place of variables to integrate algebraic functions.

However, there is no hard and fast rule for selection of trigonometric functions to replace variables as
some other substitutions are also used.

substitution for a function whose derivative is also present in the integrand. Doing so, the

3.4 Integration by Parts

Integration by parts is a special method of integration that is very helpful technique to evaluate a
wide variety of integrals that sometimes do not fit any of the basic integration formula. This method
is used to find the integrals by reducing them into standard forms.
J f(@)g(x)dx = f(x) J gddx — SLF'(%) J g(x)dx] dx (1)

Formula (1) is called the formula for integration by parts. Using this formula, we integrate the
product of two functions. The important thing to use this formula is the selection of given functions
given in the product as a first or second function. The function whose integration can easily be found
is considered as the second function while the first function is chosen whose derivative could be
easily found. In formula(1), f (x) is treated as first function while g(x) asa second function.

Key Facts
* Integration by parts is not applicable for functions such as Svx sinx dx.

* Wedonotaddany constant while finding the integral of the second function.

esgey 4° «Usually, ifany function is a power of x ora polynomial in x, then we take it as the first
2% function. However, if the other function is an inverse trigonometric function or
logarithmic function, then we take them as first function.

* Ifthe product of functions contains exponential and trigonometric functions, then we
can select any one of the two as a first function.

Example 13: Evaluate the integral: { xe* dx
Solution: Inthe integral { xe* dx, we take ‘x’ as first function as its derivative will reduce
it and ‘e*’ as second function.

3.5 Integration by Partial Fraction

When the terms in the sum:
yee A ;
zea * a2 ®
are combined by means of a common denominator, we obtain a single rational expression:
7x +22 me
m (e+4)(+2) (ii)
Suppose that we are faced with the problem of evaluating the integral:

x 7x +22
f (x+4)(x+2) dx

From (i) and (ii), we have:

7x +22 = 4
J Gang f Feoviag ala ler (x+4) dx + f arn

* ef ede +4 f dx = 3Iln(x + 4) + 4In(x +2) +e

This example illustrates a procedure for integrating certain rational fractions ne where the

degree of P(x) is less than the degree of Q(x). This method, known as partial fractions consists
of decomposing such rational fractions into simplest component fractions and then evaluating the
integral term by term.

Example 17; Evaluate: .[ 22 dx

3.6 The Definite Integral
This section introduces the definite integral, a fundamental mathematical tool that establishes
relationships between area and other essential quantities including length, volume, density,
probability, and work.

3.6.1 Partition of the Interval

A partition of the interval [a, 5] is a collection
of points:

A=X% <x <%X2< X30 SM <X, HH
that divides [a, 5] into n subintervals of lengths:

Axz = X3 — X2, 0, AXpy = Xq — Xn-1

The partition is said to be regular provided all
subintervals have the same length:

In the figure, each partition looks like a rectangle.
For a regular partition, widths of the rectangles
approach to zero as n is.made large,

Area of first (left most) rectangle = length x width= f(x,) Ax,
Area under the curve = sum of areas of rectangles

= f (x)Ax, + f (x2) Ax + f (x3)Ax3 ++ +f Xn AXn

n
=) fr), ome O
k=1
Expression (i) represents approximation of sum of areas of n rectangles.
Based on our inductive concept, the area under the curve and between the interval [a, 5] is:

n
A= lim Be F(xp)Atp nw. (if)

=1
Expression (ii) provides the fundamental concept of integral calculus and form the basis of the
following definition.

Definition 3.2: A function f is said to be integrable on a finite closed interval [a, ] if the limit:

n
dm, 2, f(eudd
=1
exists and does not depend upon the choice of partitions or on the choice of the points x; in the
subintervals. In the such case, we denote the limit by the symbol:

[ f(x)dx = him ») Fp) Ary se vee (Hit)

Expression (iii) is called the definite integral of, f from a to b. The numbers a and b are called
lower limit and upper limit of integration respectively and f (x) is called the integrand.

--- PAGE 106 ---
EES, pea eae Riataoaiessied
Theorem 3,2: If a function f is continuous on an interval [a, b] then f is integrable on [a, b] and
the net signed area under the curve between the interval [a, 5] is:
A= [ f(x)dx

In the simplest cases, definite integrals of continuous functions can be calculated using formulas
from plane geometry to compute the shaded area.

Example 20:

Sketch the region where area is represented by the definite integral sini evaluate the integral
using an appropriate formula from geometry.

So, the region is a rectangle of height 3 drawn over 3

From figure (1), we have:

(ii) Graph of the integral is the line y = x +3. ‘Fig. (1)

When x=2, y=2+3=5

So, the region is trapezoid where base ranges

So, the region is upper right quarter-circle of radius 1
centred at origin.
From figure (3), we have:

When x=1, y=1-1=0
The region is a triangle from x = 0 to x = 1.
From figure (4), we get:
fe — 1)dx = area of triangle =>) => sq. units

(ii) The graph of the integral is the line y = x —1.
Whenx=0, y=0-1=-1
When x=1, y=1-1=0
When x =2; y=2-1=1
The regions are two triangles from x = —1 tox = 0
and:x = 1 to x = 2, From figure (5), we get:
fe — Idx = [2 = 1dx + f7(e - Idx
= area of triangle Ai + Area of triangle A2
== (1)(1) + 5 (1)(1) = 1 sq. units
Note: In the figure (5), the area of triangle A: is below the x-axis and the area of triangle A2 is
above x-axis, therefore:
Ai = —4 and Ao == which implies Ai + Ao= —3+==0
But area cannot be negative, therefore in such case, we take net aca as
i
Ai+Aa=s+2=1

3.7 Properties of The Definite Integral

In the finite closed interval [a, b], when upper limit of integration in the definite integral is greater
than the lower limit of integration (a < ), the following facts are true.

(i) If lower and upper limits of integration are equal, then area is zero. i ie.,

[ f(x)dx =0

2
( xdx=0
2
(ii) If the lower limit of integration is greater than the upper limit of integration, then:
a b
 fenar =- | sear
b a

Which states that interchanging the limits of integral reverses the sign of integral.

3.8 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
In this section, we will establish two basic relationships between definite and indefinite integrals that
together constitute a result called the ‘Fundamental Theorem of Calculus’, We will provide a
powerful method for evaluating definite integrals using anti-derivatives.

We consider a non-negative and continuous function { on
an interval [a, 4]. The area A under the graph f over the
interval [a, 5] is represented by the definite integral:

A=] f(x)dx....... (i)

From (i), we have: } Fig. (6)

A(a)=0 [The area under the curve from a to a is the area above the single point a and
hence is zero.]

Similarly, A(b) = A cua vale bhechoneieeds

--- PAGE 110 ---
The formula A’(x) = f(x) provides that A(x) is an anti-derivative of f(x) which implies that
every other anti-derivative of f (x), on [a, b] can be obtained by adding a constant to A(x).
By definition of anti-derivative, suppose:

F(x) = A(x) +... (ii)
We check what happens when we subtract F(a) from F(b). From (ii):
F(a) = A(a) + Coe ee oe (iii) and F(b)=A(b)+c.......... (iv)
Subtracting (iii) from (iv):
F(b) — F(a) = [A() +c] — [A(a) +c] = A(b) — A(a) = A-—O=A p
Therefore, from (i), we have:

b
aise i) f()dx = F(b) — F(@) wu ne (0)

Statement: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that if f is continuous on [a, b] ad F is
antiderivative of f on [a, 5), then: ="
b +”
f (x)dx = F(b) — F(a)
a

This can be written as:
b
[ reodx = FOr? = F@) - F@)

We can emphasise that a and b are values for the wapeple =
! Thus, the definite integral can be evaluated by finding Cod opt-deciverive ofthe integral andthen
subtracting the value of this anti-derivative at the lower limit of integration from its value at the }

3.9 Area and Volume

The definite integrals have applications that extend far beyond the area problems. In this section, we
will also apply definite integrals for finding the volume. We have an inductive idea of what is meant
by the area of certain geometrical figures. It is a number that in same way measures the size of the
region enclosed by the figure. The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width likewise
the area ofa triangle is half the product of lengths of the base and the altitude.

The area of a polygon may be defined as the sum of the areas of triangles into which it is decomposed
and it can be proved that the area thus obtained is independent of how the polygon is decomposed
into triangles.

--- PAGE 113 ---
However, how do we define the area of a region in a plane if the region is bounded by a curve? We
even certain that such a region has an area? In the same way volume of solids can be found by using
definite integration. |
3.10 Area of Bounded Region

3.10.1 Area Between a Curve and the X-axis
If f is a non-negative continuous function on [a, 5],
then the area ungssthe graph of f from a to b is:

ove a F(xdax

Example 28: Find the area of the region bounded by the line 2y + x = 8, the x-axis and, the
lines x = 2 and x = 4.

3.10.2 Area Between Curves |
If the function f (x) is greater than the function g(x) for all x between a and b, then the area

under the graph of f(x) minus the area under the graph of g(x) is the area between the curves.
Thus, the area between the curves f@) and g(x) is:

A= f [F(x) — g(x)ldx ; f(x) > o(x) |

Example 29: Find the area of the region bounded by graphs of: ‘ :

3.11 Volume of Solids of Revolution

3.11.1 Dise Method

Consider a region bounded by the graph of y = f (x) and the x-axis between x = a and x = b
that is rotated about x-axis. If a = x9 < x; < x2... < X_ = b is partition of the interval [a, 5],

the volume V of the resulting 3-D region can approximated by the sum of volumes of discs
obtained after rotation.

The radius and height of dises D, are f(x), and Ax;

3.12 Applications
3.12.1 Consumer and Producer Surpluses
Economists use the definite integral to define the concept of consumer and producer surpluses.
The demand for a commodity by consumers as well as the amount supplied to the market by the
manufacturers can often be expressed as a function of the per unit price. Let D(x) and S(x) be the
number of units demanded and the number of units supplied, respectively, when the commodity sells
ata price x per unit.
Ifthe demand equals the supply:

D(x) = S(x)
The market is said to be in equilibrium and the corresponding price of the commodity is called the
equilibrium price. If p is the equilibrium price and b is the price at iy the demand of the
commodity is zero (b (s)= 0), the integral:

Cs = { D(x)dx
P
is called the consumer surplus. Similarly, the persis

Ps = j S(x)ax

where S(c) = 0, is s called the producer surplus.

--- PAGE 116 ---

Example 32:

Suppose the demand and supply of a commodity selling for x dollars a unit and

D(x) = 1000 — 20x and S(x) = x? + 10x, respectively. Find the consumer and producer surplus.

Solution: From the graph it is clear that D(x) = 0 when b =.50, S(x) = 0 when c = 0 and

D(s) = S(x) for p = 20. Cs represents the area under the graph of D(x) on the interval

[20, 50] and Ps is the area under the graph of S(x) on [0, 20]. We have:
50 .

Cs = j D(x)dx = J (1000 — 20x)dx

Cs = 1000052233" = $9000

3.12.2 Rectilinear Motion
If f (¢) is the position function of an object moving in ~ 5 arene line, then we have:
velocity = v(t) = and acceleration =.a(t) = =
By using the definition of anti-derivative, the quantities S ae v can be written as indefinite integrals.
S(t)=Jfv(t)dt and v(t) =fa(t)dt

By knowing the initial position $(0) and the initial velocity v(0), we can find specific values of
the constants of integration.

3.12.3. Work

In physics when a constant force F moves an object a distance d in the same direction, the work done
is defined as W = Fd.
Definition: Let F(x) be a continuous force acting at a point in the interval [a, 5], then the work
done W by the force on moving an object from a to b is:

Ww = | F(x)dx

3.12.4 Motion of Spring a

Hook's law states that “when a spring is stretched (or compressed)

beyond its natural length, the restoring force exerted by the spring is

directly proportional to the amount of elongation (or

compression)”. Thus, in order to stretch a spring, x units beyond its

natural length, we need to apply the force:

F(x) = kx; k is spring constant.

Example 34: ca

A force of 130 N is required to stretch a spring 50 cm. Find the work done in stretching the

spring 20 cm beyond its natural (unstretched) length.

Solution:

x = 50cm = 0.5m and F = 130N

Substituting values of x and F in F = kx, we have:

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

After studying this unit, students will be able to:
Identify and construct first order differential equations from practical situations.
Give the concept of solution of differential equation.

Solve differential equations of first order and first degree of the form:
* separable variables equations,

= homogeneous equations,
Solve real life problems related to differential equations such as population growth

and decay, cooling/warming law, flow of electricity, series circuit, economics and
finance, radioactive decay etc.

Differential equations are mathematical equations that describe relationships between a function
and its derivatives. They are essential for modeling real-world phenomena in various fields. These
equations are used to describe how quantities change over time and how they relate to each other.
Differential equations are essential tools for modeling dynamic systems in real life.

These equations have wide-ranging applications across various fields of science and engineering, as
they are fundamental in modeling dynamic systems and natural phenomena. In physics, they
describe the motion of objects under forces, such as in Newton's laws and wave propagation. In
biology, they are used to model population dynamics, the spread of diseases, and the interaction
between species in ecosystems. In engineering, differential equations are crucial for analyzing
electrical circuits, control systems, and mechanical vibrations. In chemistry, they help in
understanding reaction rates and diffusion processes. In economics, they are used to model
investment growth, market behavior, and optimization problems. Overall, differential equations
serve as powerful tools for understanding and predicting the behavior of systems that change over
time or space.

Introduction
Many problems in engineering and science can be formulated in terms of differential equations. The
formulation of mathematical models is basically to address real-world problems which have been
one of the most important aspects of applied mathematics. Differential equations arise in many areas
of science and technology, specifically whenever a relation involving some continuously varying
quantities and their rates of change in space and/or time (expressed as derivatives). This is illustrated
in classical mechanics, where the motion of a body is described by its position and velocity as the
time varies. Newton's laws allow relating the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces
acting on a body and state this relation as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body
as a function of time. Such equations are called differential equations.

A mathematical model is a mathematical construction such as a differential equation, that simulates
a natural engineering phenomenon. Most applications of differential equations take the form of
mathematical models. For example, consider the problem of determining the velocity v of a falling
object.

Newton's second law of motion tells us that the net force on the

object is equal to the product of the mass, m and its acceleration, =

dv t
Moet =F
This law is a differential equation as it contains derivative.
Ignoring air resistance, for an object falling close to the Earth's
surface the force is F = mg, directed downward, where g is
approximately 9.80 meters per second per second, Thus, the
differential equation:

dv
m= = mg
is amathematical model corresponding to the free-falling object.
Key Facts

A good mathematical model has two important properties:
* Itis sufficiently simple that the mathematical problem can be solved.
* It represents the actual situation sufficiently well so that the solution to the

| mathematical problem predicts the behavior of the real problem.

4.1 Differential Equation

A differential equation is an equation containing one or more derivatives of an unknown function. A
differential equation is an ordinary differential equation if it involves an unknown function of only
one variable. For now, we will consider in this unit only ordinary differential equation just call them

ordinary differential equation. It contains one or more of its derivatives with respect to the
independent variable.

that is, it satisfies the following two conditions:

(b) all the coefficients a,,(x), aq_; (x), .. ,@ (x), a9(x) and the function f(x) are either constants
or depend only on the independent variable (x).
Note: If any one of these two conditions is not satisfied, then the DE is said to be nonlinear DE.

The differential equation y?(x — 3)2 = 2xy? is not linear, but it can be reduced to linear
differential equation if we divide both sides of it by y* as follows:

or (x —3) = = 2x which is linear differential equation.

4.3 Concept of Solution of Differential Equation

Differential equations are mathematically studied from several different perspectives, mostly
concerned with their solutions as the set of functions that satisfy the equation.

A solution of a differential equation is any function f defined on some interval I that reduces the
equation to an identity.

Example 3:
Show that x? + y? =c is a solution of the differential equation y = ~ +x = 0. Also plot the
graph of solution.
Solution: We have x? + y? =c
Differentiating w.r.t. x, we get:
2x+2y2=0 or y2+x=0
Hence, x? + y? = c is the solution of differential equation y2 +x=0.
We note that the solution, x? + y? = c depends upon an arbitrary constant c.
. By choosing different values of c, we get different solutions.
Let us take c = 1,4, 9, 16,... then we get different solutions as:
x+y? 212 1?
. x*+y? =4=2?
x? +y? =9 = 3* Fig. (i)
x? +y? =16=4 andsoon.
These solutions represent a family of circles with radii 1, 2, 3, 4, ... with centre (0, 0) in Fig. (i).
Thus, the solution, x? + y? = c represents a family of infinite number of circles,

4.3.1 General Solution of DE

The solution that contains as many arbitrary constants as the order of the differential equation is
called a general solution. It is the relation between the independent variables x and dependent
variable y which is obtained after removing the derivatives (by integration) where the relation
contains arbitrary constant to denote the order of an equation. In the above example, x? + y? =c is
the general solution.

4.3.2 Particular Solution of DE

The solution free from arbitrary constants is called a particular solution.

If particular values are given to the arbitrary constant, the particular solution of the differential
equations is obtained. In the above example, x? + y* = 4, x* + y? = 9 etc. are the particular
solutions. 4
Key Facts

Differentiating (ii) with respect to x, we get:

Substituting the values in the left side of given differential equation:
y" —2y' + y = xe* + 2e* — 2(xe* + e*) + xe*

Which is true Vxe R. Thus, y = xe* is a solution of the differential equation
y" — 2y’ + y =0 on the interval (—09, +00),
Note: In examples (4) and (5), we notice that the constant function y = 0 for (—oo < x < +00)

We know that the solution of an algebraic equation say, x? — 5x + 6 = 0 , is the value of x that
satisfies the given equation.

But the solution of a differential equation say, y dy = x dx , means to remove derivative from the
given differential equation by using some technique/procedure. All these techniques involve
integration. After removing derivative, the dependent variable y in terms of independent variable
x (explicit: y = f(x) or implicit: g(x, y) = 0) willbe the solution of differential equation.

4.6.2 Homogeneous Differential Equations
A differential equation of the form:
M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0 (1)
is said to be homogeneous if both M and N are homogeneous functions of the same degree.
In other words, differential equation (1) is homogeneous if
M(tx,ty) =t"M(x,y) and N(tx,ty)=t"N(x,y)
have the same degree n. The differential equation can be reduced to separable variables by either
substituting y = ux or x = vy, where u and v are new dependent variables. In particular, if we
choose y = ux, then:
sutxS or dy =udx+xdu
Hence the differential equation becomes:
P(x, ux)dx + Q(x,ux)[udx + xdu] = 0

> x"P(1,u)dx + x"Q(1,u)[udx + xdu] = 0

4.7 Applications of Differential Equations

Differential equations can be applied in solving problems arising in engineering and physical
sciences such as physics, chemistry, biology and economics etc.

First order ordinary differential equations are used to calculate the movement or flow of electricity,
motion of a pendulum and a falling object, to explain thermodynamics concepts and population

growth etc. Also, in medical terms, they are used to check the growth of diseases in graphical
representation.

Example 16:

representing the flow phenomenon and find the velocity of the ball after 1 second. Also find the
velocity with which the ball hits the ground. Neglect the air resistance.

vim mere A thermometer showing the

Thus, v = gt ......(i) outdoors. After 8 minutes it reads 25°C
Substituting the values, : and after another 8 minutes it reads
ke oe 30°C. Using Newton's law of cooling,
v= 98x 1=9.8m/s find the outdoors temperature.
Which is velocity of the ball after 1 second.
‘ Now from (i)
2 = gt where S is the distance covered by the ball.
‘ dS = gtdt
Integrating both sides, se have:

S=gite, sc. (ii)
At t = 0,5 = 0, therefore from (ii), c. = 0.
and, S=g* implies

20= 98x or t= 202sec

Now from (i)
v = 9.8 x 2.02 = 19.8m/s

Thus, the velocity with which the ball hits the ground is 19.8m/s.
Example 17;
According to Newton, cooling ofa hot body is proportional to the temperature difference between its
temperature T and the temperature T, of its surrounding medium. Ifa body at 90°C is allowed to cool
in air with temperature 30°C and if it is observed after 5 min the body has cooled to 70°C, find the
temperature of the body as a function of time.
L Solution: The mathematical formulation of Newton’s law of cooling in this problem is:
SEO (T= Tp) eoseesserses (1)
Introducing a proportionality constant k > 0, the above equation can be written as:
B= K(T = 1p) oesseseen (2)

Here, T is the temperature of the body and ¢ is the time, 7p is the temperature of the surrounding

and = is the rate of cooling of the body. Substituting, 7, = 30° in equation (2), we get:

 . = je ie
S=k(T-30) = = kat

--- PAGE 138 ---
UNIT-04; DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

Integrating both sides, we get:

In(T — 30) = kt+iInc_ where c is the constant of integration.
In(T — 30) = Ine**+Inc = In(T -—30) = In(ce**)

Taking antilog, we get:

T — 30 = ce** (3)

Imposing the initial condition T(0) = 90°, we find:

90-30=c => c2z60

Therefore (3) implies:

T-30=60e% = T=60e" +30 .......... (4)

To find the value of constant k, we use the second condition T(5) = 70° in (4).

70 = 60e* +30 = 60e*=40 = e* =

5k = in(2) > k=tin (2) = —0,081

Substituting the value of X in relation (4), we have:

We see leaves falling from trees, movement of rockets and
water flowing from the river. We walk, we run, we drive a car
these are the activities that we carry out in our day-to-day life.
These activities can be defined as motion. Motion is the change
in position or orientation of a body. For example, a body on the
surface of the Earth may appear to be at rest, but that is only
because the observer is also on the surface of the Earth. The
Earth itself, together with both the body and the observer, is
moving in its orbit around the Sun and rotating on its own axis at
all times in the same way.

5.1 Scalar and Vector Quantities
Physical quantities are divided into two categories, scalars and vectors. If only a magnitude is
required to express a quantity, then the quantity is known as scalar and if both magnitude and
direction are required to express a quantity then the quantity is known as vector quantity. e.g. time,
distance, mass are scalars and velocity, acceleration, weight are vectors.
5.1.1 Distance
Distance is a scalar quantity since it only describes how much path is covered by a moving object
regardless of direction. For example, you travel 3Km due north and then 2km due west then the total
path covered is Skm.
5.1.2 Speed
Speed is also a scalar quantity since it represents how fast an object is moving regardless of its
direction. For example, if you drive a car at the speed of 50km/hr it represents how fast you are
moving no matter you are moving in which direction.
5.1.3 Displacement B
Change in position of an object is known as displacement. It is a
vector quantity because it includes both the magnitude i.e.
distance between the initial position and final position and the
direction i.e. straight path from the initial position to the final
position. For example if you move al along a curved path going
from A to B then the straight path AB is the displacement. i: Pisani Dhl .
5.14 Velocity
Velocity is also a vector quantity, since it describes both how fast and in which direction an object is
moving. In other words, rate of change of displacement with respect to time is called velocity. For
example, a car moving 50km/h due west then its velocity is S0km/h westward.
5.2 Displacement-Time Graph
A moving object has different positions with respect to time. At any time ‘t’ what is the position
of object is represented on a graph known as displacement-time graph. While drawing the graph:
* Displacement values are drawn along y-axis (vertical axis)(time dependent quantity).
. * Time is taken along x-axis (horizontal axis)(independant quantity).

Note that independent values are taken along x-axis and the dependent values along y-axis.
5.2.1 Displacement-Time Graph for Uniform Motion

* This-is the graph between the displacement and the time when the motion of object is uniform.
This graph is always a straight line and slope of this line is non-zero.

Here are some key points
about the displacement-time
graph.

--- PAGE 142 ---
ORS RE UNIT-05; KINEMATICS OF

5.2.2 Slope of Displacement-time Graph

Let after time ‘t’ the object moving with uniform
speed is at point ‘P’ where its displacement is ‘d’.
From figure slope of the graph = '

By definition, ratio of displacement d with time ‘t’
is velocity of the object. Therefore:

Slope of graph = velocity of the object

Since time is always non-negative and the displacement may be positive or negative.

Therefore, slope may be positive or negative. Greater the value of slope means higher the velocity
(+ve or -ve ) of the object and smaller the value of slope means lower the velocity of object. If slope
of the graph is zero (line is horizontal), then velocity of the object is zero.

5.2.3 Direction of Slope |

If slope is positive, it indicates that particle is moving in the positive (anti-clockwise) direction and
the negative slope indicates that particle is moving in the negative (clockwise) direction.

5.2.4 Velocity-Time Graph

The velocity time graph is the graph plotted between the

velocity of the particle with the passage of time. From the

graph we can extract various kinds of information e.g.

velocity and speed of particle at any time ¢, distance

travelled by the particle, acceleration, average speed and

average velocity etc. Velocity is plotted along y-axis and

time along x-axis.

When the particle is moving with constant velocity then the

graph is a horizontal line. Constant velocity means for
different values of time the velocity is same. . .

A body is said to have a uniform acceleration if its velocity is changing by an equal amount in equal

intervals of time. |

--- PAGE 143 ---
In the case when body is moving with uniform acceleration the velocity-time graph is along a
non-horizontal and non-vertical line.

0 time —> X-axis

Positive acceleration Negative acceleration

5.2.5 Slope of Velocity-Time Graph y-axis
Case I: When velocity isconstant.

As we know that when velocity is constant then the
graph is along a horizontal line so its slope is zero.
Case II: When acceleration is uniform.

For the particle which is moving with the uniform
acceleration the graph is non-horizontal and non-
vertical line. Consider any of the case with +
positive or negative acceleration.

Area between the Graph and the X-axis

The area between the graph and the x-axis gives the displacement of the particle in that interval of the
time.

This gives us the instantaneous velocity of the particle at time ‘t’. For a particular value of ‘t’
we will get the velocity of the particle at that particular time.

5.6 Vector Valued Function

Vector valued functions provide a useful method for studying various curves both in plane and in
three-dimensional space. We can apply this concept to calculate the velocity, acceleration, arc length
and curvature of an object's trajectory.

Definition: A vector valued function is a function where the domain is the subset of real numbers

and the range is a vector. In three dimensions r(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k, where x, y, and z are
the functions of ¢ or may be constants.

--- PAGE 154 ---
| imeeyaenraee cetyl

The example of the vector valued functions is

r(t) = 3t + tf + (sint)k

5.6.1 Domain and Range of Vector valued Function

The domain of a vector-valued function r(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k is the set of all t’s for which
all the component functions x(t), y(t) and z(t)are defined. If r(t) is defined in terms of
component functions and the domain is not specified explicitly, then the domain is the intersection
of the domains of the component functions. The range of a vector-valued function is the set of all
possible output values that the function can produce, which are the vectors.

Example 6: Find the domain of r(t) = In|t — 1|i + ej + Vtk
Solution: Here x(t) =In|t-—1], y(t)=e' and = 2z(t)= vt

Domain of x(t) is (—09, 1) U (1, 0)

Domain of y(t) is (—©9, 00)

Domain of z(t) is [0, 00)

Thus, the domain of the function is

{(—00, 1) U (1,00)} N {(—09, 20)} A {[0, c0)} = [0,1) U (1, 0)
5.6.2 Construction of Vector Valued Function
Consider a particle is moving in space then its vector function can be constructed by considering it
motion along x-, y- and z-axes. Suppose that the motion of particle along x- and y-axes is in circular
shape and z-axis is changing linearly 3 times with time, then its vector function is given by
r = (cost) + (sint)j + 3tk
5.6.3 Scalar Valued Function
A function from a vector to some constant is known as scalar valued function,
For example, when we take the magnitude of the vector or the dot product of two same vectors then
the vector valued function becomes a scalar valued function. Let us consider the vector:
r = 32+tj+(sint)k
Its magnitude is |r| = |3¢ + tf + (sint)k|
= /3? + t?2+sin?t = J9 + t2+sin?t

The value the function V9 + t?+ sin? t also depends on the scalar variable 1.

5.6.5 Velocity and Acceleration of a Vector Valued Function
The derivative of the vector valued function gives the velocity of the function at the particular point
and if we take again the derivative of the velocity function then it will be acceleration of the function
at the particular point.
Consider the function in space
| f() =fA(Oi+AOj+ Ak
Then f(t) is differentiable at t = ty and its derivative is given as

f'(to) = V(to) = f's(to)t + f'2(to)j + F's (tok where f'(to) = v(to)
Which gives the velocity of the function at t = ty and for the acceleration of the function again
we differentiate the velocity function to get the acceleration

Three or more lines that intersect at one common point are said to be concurrent lines. When a third
line passes through the point of intersection of the first two lines, then these three lines are known as
the concurrent lines.

6.2.2 Point of Concurrency

The point of intersection of three or more lines is known as the “point of concurrency.” It is the point
where three or more lines intersect.

If the lines (1) to (3) are concurrent then they must intersect at a point O(x, y) which can be found by
solving equations (1) to (3) simultaneously. The system (4) has a non-trivial solution if the
detenninant of coefficients of the three lines is zero. i.e.,

(b) Direct Viethod
In this method, we first find the point of intersection of two lines and then check if the point lies on

the third line. It ensures that all three lines are concurrent. | (Check Point mmm

Step 1: To find the point of intersection of line (1) and line (2), substituting the value of 'y' from
‘ equation (2) in equation (1) we get:
4x—2(x+2)-4=0
_ 4x=-2x-4-4=0

2x-8=0 = 2x=8 > x=4
Substituting the value of x in equation (2), we get:
y=44+2 =6

Therefore, line (1) andlline (2) intersect at the point (4, 6).
Step 2: Substituting the point of intersection of the first two lines in the equation of the third a,
we get:
2(4) + 3(6)=26 => 8 Pt =26 => 26=26
This implies that the line (3) alee through the point (4, 6). Hence the three lines are
concurrent.
6.3 Concurrent Lines in Triangles
In a triangle, the three angle bisectors, perpendicular bisectors, medians and altitudes are examples
of concurrent lines.
* Incenter: The point of intersection of three angle bisectors of a triangle i is known as the incenter
ofa triangle.

6.6 Application of Analytic Geometry

Analytic geometry is used in physics and engineering, and also in aviation, rocketry, space science,
and spaceflight. It is the foundation of most modern fields of geometry, including algebraic,
differential, discrete and computational geometry. See the following examples for understanding.
Example 8:

An engineer needs to design a traffic intersection where three straight roads meet. The roads are
represented by the equations of lines. The roads are given by the following equations:

2x —4y +5 = 0,7x — By + 5 = Oand 4x + Sy = 45

Determine if the roads are concurrent and if so, find the point of intersection of roads.

Solution: la’

2x—-4y+5 = 0 (1)

: 7x —-8y+7=0 (2)

4x+4y-—11=0 (3)
Multiplying equation (1) by —2 and adding with (2), we get:

—4x+8y-10 = 0 (4)

7x-8y+7 =0 (2)

3x-3=0 > 3x=3 => x=1
Substituting in equation (1), we have:
2(1)-4y+5=0 + -4y=-7 = y=?

Showing that two roads meet at (1, *).

Putting (1, 2) in equation (3), we get: )

4(1)+4(2)-11=0 => 4+7-11=0 = 0=0

Therefore, third road also pass through (1, 2). Hence the three roads are concurrent.
Example 9:

A triangular park is bounded by three straight roads that meet at points A(2, 3), B(8, 5) and C(5, 10).
A city planner needs to determine the area of the park for landscaping purpose. How can he

Example 10:
A railway engineer is designing an intersection where two rail tracks meet at a junction. The joint
equation representing the tracks is given by x’ — 4xy — 12y* = 0. Determine the angle between the
individual lines representing the tracks.

Solution:
Given joint equation of the tracks is:
x? —4xy —12y? =0 => x2+2xy—6xy—12y?=0

=> x(x+2y)—6y(x+2y)=0 => (x+2y)(x-6y)=0
The lines representing the tracks are:

x+2y=0 (i)

From (i) and (ii), we have:
y=—5x (iii)
y= =x (iv)

7.1 Conics and Its Family Members
The plane shapes like circle, ellipse, parabola and hyperbola, which

are formed with the intersection of a right circular cone and a plane Ca ie. ,
are known as conic section. First of all, we will discuss that what is a

right circular cone and a plane. When the line segment OP rotates

about the circumference of a circle of any radius greater than zero

with O as fixed point the shape formed is called a right circular cone.

The fixed point O is called the vertex of the cone. The ray OA is called

the axis of the cone, as OA is perpendicular to the radius AP of the

circle that's why this cone is called right circular cone. The line

segment OP (or any line segment) which join the point O with the

circumference of the circle.is called generator (ruling). Note that a

flat or two-dimensional surface that extends indefinitely is called a O

plane.

Circle: When we cut a cone with a plane so that plane is perpendicular to the axis of cone and not
passing through vertex then the intersection isa circle.

Parabola: When we cut a cone with the plane such that plane is parallel to any generator or ruling
not passing through the vertex then the intersection is a parabola.

Ellipse: When we cut a cone with the plane such that plane is slightly tilted not passing through the
vertex then the intersection is an ellipse.

Hyperbola: When a cone is inverted and is joined with an erected cone such that the vertices of the
two cones lie at the same point and their axes of are also same then a shape is formed shown in the
figure. When plane intersects the cone parallel to the axis of the cone such that the plane does not pass
through the vertex O, then the shape formed on the plane is called hyperbola.

Note: In case when the plane passes through the vertex then the intersection of plane and the cone isa
point ora pair of intersecting lines. These conic sections are known as degenerate conics.

7.2 Circle
It is set of all points in the plane which are equidistant from a fixed point in the plane.

The fixed point is called the centre of the circle and distance of any point on the circle from the centre
is called the radius of the circle.

Consider a circle with centre at C(h, k) and radius r. Take any point P(x.y)
P(x, y) on the circle. Then by definition of the circle. od

Squaring both sides
=> (x-h)??+Q-k)? =r’
This is the standard form of equation ofei circle with centre at C(h, k) and radius r.
In particular if the centre of the circle is at origin, i.e. (h, k) = (0,0) then equation of circle is

(x-—0)? +(y-0)*@ =r? => x? 4y? =r?
Example 1: Find the equation of circle with centre at (2, — 5) and radius 3 units.
Solution: Given that the centre (h, k) = (2, —5) and radius r = 3.
Equation of circle is (x — h)? + (y — k)? =r?
Putting values of h, k and r, we get required equation of circle as follows:
(x — 2)? + (y—(-—5))? =37 =>) (x —2)? + (y +5)? =9
7.2.2 General Form of Equation of Circle
As we know that the standard form of the equation of circle is:
(x —h)*? + (y—k)? =r?
=> x? —2hx +h? + y? —2ky +k? =r?
=> x? + y? — 2hx — 2ky +h? +k? —r? =0 (i)
Letting h? + k? — r? = c, —2h = 2g and —2k = 2f, the equation (i) becomes:
x? +y?+29x+2fy+c=0
Which is the general form of the equation of circle.
Theorem 7.1: Prove that x? + y* + 2gx + 2fy +c = 0, represents a circle in general.
Proof: Given equation is:
x? +y?+2gx+2fy+c=0

=> (x? + 2gx) + (y* +2fy)+c¢=0
‘=> (x? + 29x +g" — g*) + (y? + 2fy +f? —f%7+c=0
=> (x? + 2gx + g*) + (y? + 2fy + f?) + (-—g? —f? +0) =0
=(x+g?+0t+f)? =9° +f? -c

Comparing it with (x — h)? + (y — k)? = r?, we have hh = — g; k= —f;r= fg? +f? —c.
Thus, the given equation represents a circle with centre = (h,k) = (— g,— p and

Example 2: Find the centre and radius of the circle x? + y? — 6x — 10y + 18 = 0.
Solution:
To find the centre and radius we convert the given equation of circle into its standard form
(x? — 6x) + (y? — 10y) +18 =0
(x? — 6x +9—9) + (y?-—10y + 25 — 25) +18 =0
(x? — 6x + 9) + (y? — 10y + 25) -9-—25+18=0
(x — 3)? +(y—5)?-16=0> (x-3)?+(y-—5)?=16
(x — 3)? + (y-— 5)’ = 4?
Comparing it with (x — h)? + (y — k)? = r?, we have:
Centre = (h,k) = (3,5) and radius = r = 4

1.2.3 Equation of a Circle with Different Conditions

Example 3: Find the equation of the circle passing through the points (1, 2), (2, 3) and (3, 5).

Consider a circle which passes through the points P(1, 2),

Q(2, 3) and R(3, 5). Let C(h, k) be the centre of the circle

Then, |PC] = |QC|

=> ((h— 1)? + (k— 2)? = (= 2)? + (kK - 3) a 6

Squaring both sides: :
(h — 1)? + (k — 2)? = (h—- 2)? +(k— 3)?

R(3, 5)

=>h? -2h4+1+k*? —4k4+4=h? —4h 444k? —6k+9 P(1,2)
=>2h+2k=8

=>h+k=4 (i)

Also |PC| = |RC|

=> J/(h—1)? + (k— 2)? = J(h— 3)? + (k - 5)?

Squaring both sides:

(h — 1)? + (k —2)? = (h— 3)? + (k —5)?
=> h?-2h+1+k? —4k4+4=h? —6h4+94+k? — 10k +25

=> 4h+6k = 29 (ii)
Multiplying (i) with 4 and subtracting (ii) from it, we get:
=> 4h+4k = 16
_4h+6k = _29 4
—2k = —13 > k= Bs
Putting in (i), we get:

Thus, the centre of circle = C +,2 f

Example 4: Find the equation of the circle passing through the points (1, 0), (0, 1) and having its
centre on the line x —~2y +3 = 0..

Solution: Consider a circle which is passing through the two given points P(1, 0) and Q(0, 1). -
Let C(h, k) be the centre of the circle.

Given that C(h, k) lies on the line x — 2y + 3 = 0. Thus:

h-2k+3=0 (i

Also |PC| = |QC| .

= ¥(h—- 1)? + (k-0)? = /(h—0)? + (k— 1) eo Ee
Squaring both sides

=> (h—1)? + (k — 0)? = (h—0)? + (k ~ 1)?
=> h? —2h+1+k? =h? +k? -—2k 41 (1, 0)
=>-2h+2k=0>-h+k=0 . ;
>h=k (ii) |
Using equation (ii) in equation (i), we get: ,
k-2k+3=0 >-k=-3>k=3
Putting the value of k in (ii), we get h = 3.
Therefore, the centre of the circle is C(h, k) = C(3, 3).
The radius of the circle is:
r = |cP| = (3 - 1)? + GB —0)? = V449 = V13 on
The equation of the circle with centre at (3, 3) and radius V13 is:
(x — 3)? + (y - 3)? = (v3)
=> x*7-6x4+9+y*-—6y+9=13 => x?+y?-6x-—6y+5=0
Example 5: Find the equation of the circle passing through the point (2, 3) and the line
x + y —4= 0 is the tangent to the circle at (3, 1).
Solution: Consider a circle passing through the point Q(2, 3) and having tangent line
x +y+3 = 0 touching the circle at point P(3, 1). Let C(h, k) be the centre of the circle. Now
\cP| = |CQ|

= J(h—3)? + (k- 1)? = J(h—- 2)? + (k - 3)? |

x-—2y+3=0

--- PAGE 187 ---
Squaring both sides; Q(2, 3)
(h— 3)? + (k —1)? = (h— 2)? + (k — 3)?

=> h?-6h+9+k?—2k+1=h? -4h4+4+4+k? —6k4+9

=> —-2h+4k=3

=> 2h-4k =-3 (i)

Since CP is perpendicular to the tangent line x + y — 4 = 0. P(3, 1)

Thus, ~~ of CP) x (slope of tangent line) = —1

=> —5)(-1) = -1k-1=h-3 x+y—4=0
ara (ii)

7.7 Parabola

“Its the set of all the points in the plane which are equidistant from a fixed point and a fixed line in the
plane (fixed point not lying on the fixed line).
The fixed point is called focus of the parabola and the fixed line is called its directrix. The ratio of

distance at any point on the parabola from its focus to its directrix is called eccentricity of the
parabola and is denoted by “e”. Since by the definition, points on the parabola are equidistant from
the focus and the directrix thus eccentricity of the parabola is 1.

--- PAGE 195 ---
UNIT-07: CONIC SECTION

7.7.1 Standard Equation of Parabola

Consider a parabola with focus F(a, 0) where a > 0

and directrix x = -aorx+a=0.

Take a point P(x, y) on the parabola then by definition

of the parabola:

7.7.2 Elements of Parabola
* __ Directrix: The fixed line is called the directrix of parabola.
Focus: The fixed point (not lying on the directrix) is called the focus of the parabyé.
Axis of Parabola (Axis of symmetry)
The line which passes through the focus and is perpendicular to the directrix is called axis of
parabola and its equation is y = 0. Axis of parabola is also known as axis of symmetry.
Vertex of Parabola:
The point where the parabola cuts its axis is called vertex of the parabola. In this case 0(0, 0)
is the vertex of the parabola which is closest to the focus.
Chord of a Parabola:
A line segment with its end points on the parabola is called chord of iat.

Focal Chord:
A chord of the parabola which passes through the focus of parabola is called focal chord.

--- PAGE 196 ---
Focal Distance:
The distance of any point of the parabola from the focus is called focal distance.
Latus rectum of Parabola:
A focal chord of the parabola which is parallel to the directrix of a parabola is called latus rectum
of the parabola and its length is 4a.
7.7.3 Standard Equation of Parabola
When the vertex is at any arbitrary point V(Alk)
V(h, k) and the axis of symmetry is parallel V(h,k)
to x-axis then equation of parabola then:
(y — k)? = 4a(x — h)
or (y — k)? = —4a(x —h)
Similarly, equation of the parabola with
vertex at any arbitrary point V(h, k) and
the axis of symmetry parallel to y-axis is V(h,k)
(x — h)? = 4a(y —k)
or (x —h)? = —4a(y —k)
7.7.4 Length of Latus Rectum of Parabola
Consider the parabola y? = 4ax. Its focus is at
F(a, 0) and vertex is at V(0, 0).
Let / be the length of the latus rectum AB then
|FA| = <. Therefore, the coordinates of A are (a,+).
Since the point A(a, <) lies on the parabola y? =
Thus, it must satisfy its equation. i.¢.;
(!) = 4a(a) stata =/ = 16a? >l=+4a
Since length is always positive, so the length of latus rectum of the parabola is:

V(h,k)

B(a,—1/2)

Example 11: -
Find the equation of parabola with focus at (2, 5) and the equation of directrix is x + 8 = 0.
Solution: ica

Consider any point P(x, y) on the parabola with
Focus at F(2,5) and equation of directrix x + 8=0.
By the definition of the parabola

|PF| = |PM|

|x +8]
=> (x - 2)? + — 5)’ = ee

x+8=0

--- PAGE 197 ---
Squaring both sides: .
=> (x — 2)? + (y— 5)? = (x +8)? => (y—5)? =(x+8)? -—(x-2)?
=> (y —5)* = x* + 16x + 64—x* + 4x —4
= (y —5)* = 18x + 60 = (y - 5)? = 18(x +2
Which is the required equation of parabola.
7.7.5 Elements of Parabola and its Graph
To find the elements of parabola when its equation is given; first we convert the given equation
into the standard form and then compare it with one of the four standard equations and then find
the elements of parabola.
Example 12: Find elements of parabola with equation y = x? — 3x + 7 and draw its graph.
Solution: Given equation of parabola is:
y=x*—3x+7 =>x?-3x=y-7

=x? -3x4+-5 =y-7+2 = (x-2) =y- :

Letx—5=X and y—~=Y then X*=Y or x2 = 4(8)¥

Which is of the form X? = 4aY where a = -.
Now we write the elements of the parabola.
Vertex: We know that vertex is at (0, 0) ie. (X,Y) = (0,0)
=>X=0 and Y=0
3 19 3
=»>x—>=0 and yos=0 > x=> and y=—

Thus, the vertex of the given parabola is at G,~).
Focus: The focus of the parabola is at (0, a). i.e., (X, Y) = (0, a)

=>X=0 and Y=a =x-2=0 andy-2 == =>x=: andy=5

Thus, the focus of the parabola is at (=, 5).

Length of Latus Rectum:

Length of latus rectum is 4a = 4(=) = 1 unit

Graph: To draw the graph of parabola, we find its

x-intercept and y-intercept. For x-intercept put y = 0

in the equation y = x* — 3x + 7. We have:

(i) is the equation of parabola with vertex (-: > ~e) and its branches open upwards or

downwards according as p > 0 or p < 0.

Example 13: Find elements of parabola with vertex at (2,3) and focus at (7, 3).

Solution: Given that vertex is V(2, 3) and focus is F(7, 3). Therefore, h = 2 and k = 3. Observe

that y-coordinate of both V and F is same, thus y = 3 is the axis of parabola. Since x-coordinate

of V is less than x-coordinate of F. Thus branches of parabola open on the right side.

The distance between F and V is “a”. i.c., ;
a = |FV| = /(7 — 2)? + (3-3)? = V25+0=5_

So, the equation of parabola is:
(y — k)* = 4a(x — h) ‘

=> (y — 3)* = 4(5)(x — 2) => (y — 3)? = 20(x -— 2)

Which is the required equation of parabola.

Example 14: Find elements of parabola with focus at (3, —1) and its directrix is 3x — 4y + 1 = 0.

Solution: Given that focus of the parabola is at F(3,—1) and directrix is 3x —4y + 1 = 0. If

P(x, y) is any point on the parabola then by definition of parabola.

|PF| = |PM|; where |PM| is the distance of P from directrix. Therefore:

Example 15: Find elements of parabola with vertex at (2,3) and equation of directrix is y = —4.
Solution: As we know that the focus of the parabola is on the opposite side of vertex as that of
directrix, so in this case it opens upwards. Therefore its equation is:
(x — h)? = 4a(y —k) (i)
Given that the vertex is (2,3), soh=2and k =3. Also, the distance between vertex and

7.8 Equation of Tangent and Normal of Parabola |
7.8.1 Condition for a Line to be Tangent to a Parabola .
Consider a parabola (y — k)* = 4a(x — h) (1) |
and a line . y=mx+c - (2) |
On solving these equations, we will get the points of intersections of the line and the parabola.
Using equation (2) in equation (1), we have:
. [(mx + c) — k]? = 4a(x —h)
=> [mx + (c —k)]* = 4a(x — h) |
=> m*x* + 2m(c — k)x + (c — k)? = 4ax —4ah |
=> m*x? + {2m(c — k)x — 4ax} + (c—k)* + 4ah=0 |
= m?x? + {2m(c —k) — 4a}x + (c— k)* + 4ah =0 |
On solving this equation, we will get at most two values of x. But for the line to be tangent to the 5
parabola it must intersect only at a point. i.c., Both values of x should be same, thus discriminant
of the above quadratic equation must be zero.
{2m(c — k) — 4a}* — 4m*{(c — k)? + 4ah} = 0
=> 4m?(c — k)? — 16am(c —k) + 16a? — 4m?(c — k)? — 16ahm? = |
=> —16am(c — k) + 16a? —16ahm? =0
=>-—16a[m(c —k) -—at+hm?]=0 => m(c—k)-at+hm?=0

=> m(c—k)=a—m?*h => ee
a—m?h a— mh +mk
ee this value of c in equation (2), we get:
y=mx+ a-m*h+mk _ ‘ie as m?h—mk—a
™
Which is the equation of tangent to the parabola. Here m is the slope of the tangent line.

Particular Case:
When the vertex of the parabola is at (0, 0) i.e.; h = 0 and k = 0 then equation of the tangent line is:

y = mx — O-nO)-0 = y=mx-= = y=mxet—

Example 16: Find the equation of the tangent to the parabola y? — 6y — 16x + 25 = 0 with the ’
slope 1/2.

Solution; Equation of parabola is:

, oe S2
=> y? —6y = 16x — 25 = y* — 6y +9 =16x—254+9
= (y — 3)? = 16x — 16 = 16(x — 1)
=> (y — 3)? = 4(4)(« -1)
Which is of the form (y — k)* = 4a(x — h)
Here h = 4; k = 3 anda = 4 and given that slope is m = =, therefore equation of tangent to the
parabola is: m?h-mk-a .

Which is the equation of the tangent line at P(x,,1).
In particular if vertex is at (0,0) thenh = 0, k = 0. Then, the equation of tangent line is:
2ax — (y, — 0)y — 2ax1+ Gi —O)y, =0 > 2ax—y,y—2ax,+yf =0
Since (x;, y; ) lies on the parabola, so y? = 4ax, and we have:
2ax — yyy — 2ax, + 4ax, = 0 => 2ax—y,y + 2ax,=0

7.9 Ellipse .
It is the set of all the points in the plane such that the sum of the distances a, . te: P
of each point from two fixed points in the plane remains same. The two oe
fixed points are known as foci (plural of focus) of the ellipse.
The midpoint of the foci is called the centre of ellipse.
7.9.1 Standard Equation of an Ellipse
Consider an ellipse with centre at origin and the foci on x-axis. Let the foci be F,(—c, 0) and
F2(c, 0). Also ee that sum of the distance of each pint of ellipse from foci is 2a which is
constant.

=> 4a/(x—c)? +y? =4a?-—4cx => aJf(x—c)? + y? =a? -cx
Again, squaring both sides, we have:

a?[(x —c)? + y?] = a* + c?x? — 2a*ex

=> a?[x? + c? — 2cx + y?] = at + c*x? — 2a%cx

Following are its ey

Foci
The two fixed points F,;(—c, 0) and F2(c, 0)
are known as foci of ellipse.

--- PAGE 204 ---
Major Axis
The line which passes through both the foci of ellipse is called major axis of the ellipse and its

length is 2a. In this case major axis is x-axis.
Vertices
The points where the ellipse cuts its major axis are known as the vertices of ellipse. In this case
vertices are A;(—a, 0) and A;(a, 0).
Centre
The mid-point of both the foci (or both the vertices) i is called the centre of the ellipse. In this case
(0, 0) is the centre of ellipse.
Minor Axis
The line passing through the centre of the ellipse and perpendicular to the major axis is known
as minor axis of the ellipse. Its length is 2. In this case y-axis is the minor axis.
Co-Vertices
The points where the ellipse cuts its minor axis are known as co-vertices of the ellipse. In this case

B, (0, —b) and B,(0, b) are co-vertices of the ellipse. Note that the mid point of the co-vertices is
also the centre of ellipse.

' Chord

A line segment with its end points on the 7) Mh is called chord of the ellipse.
Focal Chord

A chord which passes through any of the foci is called focal chord. e.g., B, Bz is focal chord.
Latus Rectum

A focal chord which is perpendicular to the major axis is called latus rectum of the ellipse. There
are two latus rectums (latera recta) of an ellipse through each of the foci. The length of both the
latus rectums is same and is i

Eccentricity .
The eccentricity e of ellipse is <. ie.,e= < since c < a thus eccentricity of the ellipse is always
less than 1.

Its major axis is along x-axis. Hence a = 3 and b = 2.

Thus, the centre of ellipse is at (—1, 2).

7.12 Hyperbola

It is the set of all points in a plane such that the difference of the distances of each point from
two fixed points in the plane is same. The two fixed points are known as foci of the hyperbola.
The midpoint of foci is known centre of the hyperbola.

7.12.1 Standard Form of the Equation of Hyperbola

Consider a hyperbola with centre at of.
origin and focion x — axis. Let the
foci be F,(—c, 0) and F,(c, 0) and the
difference of the distances of each
point from the foci is 2a.

Take any points P(x, y) on hyperbola then F,(¢,0)

by the definition of the hyperbola
|PF,| — |PF2| = 2a

=> J (x +c)? + (y — 0)? — J (x —c)? + (y — 0)? = 2a
=> J(x+c)?+y? =2a+ JG —c)* +y?

squaring both sides

=> x4 + % + 2cx + y* = 40? + 4a — 0)? +? +47 +24 - 2ex + ¥*

--- PAGE 213 ---
=> 4a,/(x — c)? + y? = 4cx — 4a?

> aJ(x —c)? + y? =cx—a?

Again, squaring both sides

a?[(x —c)? + y”] = c?x? + at — 2a*cx

=> a?[x? + c? — 2cx + y?] = c?x? + at — 2a*cx
=> a*x? + a?c? — Za? cx + ay? = c?x? +t — 2ddcx
=> (c2x? — a?x?) Z a*y? = a*c2 — q*

Let c? — a? = b? g
Therefore b?x? — a?y? = a?b?

Elements of Hyperbola

Consider the hyperbola >-% = 1

Foci

The two fixed points F,(—c, 0) and F,(c, 0) are the foci of the hyperbola.

Centre

The midpoint of both the foci is called the centre of the hyperbola.

Focal Axis or Transverse Axis or Real Axis

The line which passes through both the foci of hyperbola is called the focal axis. In this case

x-axis is the focal axis with equation y = 0 and its length is 2a.

Conjugate Axis or Imaginary Axis

The line passing through the centre of the hyperbola and perpendicular to its focal axis is known

as conjugate axis or imaginary axis. In this case y-axis is conjugate axis and its equation is x = 0.

The length of conjugate axis is 2b.

--- PAGE 214 ---
Vertices

The points where the hyperbola cuts its focal axis are known as the vertices of the hyperbola. In

this case A,;(—a,0) and A;(a,0) are vertices of the hyperbola. Note that the mid point of the

vertices is the centre of the hyperbola.

Co-Vertices

The points (0,—b) and (0, b) lying on the conjugate axis and equidistant from the centre are

known as co-vertices of the hyperbola.

Focal Length

The distance between the two foci is called focal length and its value is 2c. 4 .

Chord

A line segment with both end points on the same branch of hyperbola is called chord of the °

hyperbola.

Focal Chord

A chord of hyperbola which passes through the focus of the hyperbola is called focal chord.

Latus Rectum

The focal chord which is perpendicular to the focal axis is called latus rectum. There are two latus

rectums one through each of the foci. The length of each latus rectum is =.

Eccentricity

The eccentricity of hyperbola is e =< since c > a thus eccentricity of the hyperbola is always

greater than 1.

7.13 Equation of Tangent and Normal to a Hyperbola

Consider the hyperbola a —_ soe =1

hyperbola; for this use Eq (2) in (1)
(x—h)? _ (mxte-k)? _ 1

=> b?x? — 2b2hx + b2h? — a?m?x? — 2a*m(c — k)x — a?(c — k)? — a*b? =0
=> (b? — a?m*)x? — 2(b7h + a?m(c — k))x + (b7h? — a?(c — k)* — a*b*) = 0
which is quadratic equation in ‘x’.
If discriminant of this equation is greater than zero or positive the equation will have two distinct
values of x so line will cut the hyperbola at two distinct points. If discriminant of this equation is
negative then the roots of the equation will be imaginary i.e. there is no point of intersection and if
value of discriminant is zero then equation has repeated roots i.e. there is only one point of
intersection. In this case the line will be tangent to the hyperbola, so condition for the line to be
tangent to hyperbola is

Disc = 0
=> (2(b2h + a?m(c — k)) — 4(0? — ami) (bh? — a*b? — a2(c— k)?) = 0

=> 4(b7h + a?m(c — k)) — 4(b? — a2m?)(b*h* — a?b* — a*(c — k)?) =0

Dividing both sides by ‘4’

(b2h + a2m(c — k))* — (b? — a?m?)(b?h? — ab? — a?(c — k)*) = 0

Dividing both sides by a*b?

is condition for tangency.

In particular when centre of the hyperbola is at (0,0); then h = 0, k =0;

In this case condition of tangency is

(2m(0) + 1)(c — 0)? + b? + m?(0)? — a’m? = 0

7.15 Application of Conic Sections

Conic sections are counted as one of the prominent topics in Geometry and possess numerous

applications in science and technology, including astronomy, optics, and even architecture. Here we

are discussing some of them.

Example 32: A train track is 8ft wide and goes through a semi-circular tunnel of iiidien 13ft.

How high is the tunnel at edge of the track?

Solution:

Let the centre of the tunnel be at origin.

Given that radius of tunnel is 13ft. So equation of

the circle is (x — 0)? + (y — 0)? = 13?

mp x? ty? = WE elke sccs (1)

The track is 8ft wide. Let h ft be the height

of the tunnel at the edges of the track so

coordinates of the A are (—4,h) and B are

(4,h).

Since the point B(4,0) (also the point A(—4,0))

lies on the circle, so from Eq (1)

4? +h? = 169

=>h?=169-16 »h?=153 or “h=Vi53

Example 33: The cable of a suspension bridge hangs in a shape of parabola. The tower supporting

the cable are 200ft apart and 100ft in height. If the lowest point of the cable is 20ft above the

bridge at its mid point. How high is the cable from either tower at a distance of 40ft horizontally?

Solution: —100,100) A(100,100)

The vertex of the parabola is (0, 30) and it opens

upwards, so equation of parabola is:
(x — h)? = 4a(y —k)

or , °
(x — 0)? = 4a(y — 30)

=x? = 4a(y — 30) «i @) 200ft

The coordinates of the point A are (—100,100) and B are (100,100). As the point B(100,100)

(also, the point A(—100,100)) lies on parabola

So, from Eq (1)

(100)? = 4a(100 — 30)

n> 10000 = 280 => c= 22208 w= 229°
Put in Eq (1).

The point which is at a distance of soft from tower is at a distance of 100 — 40 = 60ft from
origin. Let h be the height of the cable at this point C.
The coordinates of E are (60, h) and the point lies on the parabola, so from Eq (2):

Example 34: The head light of an automobile is in the shape of parabola. The bulb is placed at
the focus which is 2 inch from its vertex. The depth of the head light is 3 inches. What is the
width of the head light at its opening?

Solution: y — axis

Consider the vertex of the

parabola is at origin and it opens on

the right side. Given that focus is at

_ 2inches from the vertex; so

(a, 0).= (2,0) >a=2

As we know equation of this parabola
is y? = 4ax so in this case

y? = 8x sxe£1)
Let ‘w’ be the width of the parabola, so
coordinates of the points A and B are
A(3,—>) and B(3, >).

Since the point B(3,=) (also point A(3, ->))

lies on the parabola, so from Eq (1)
= = 8(3) => w = 48 inches

Example 35: According to Kepler's law planets have elliptical orbits with Sun at one of the foci.
If the longest distance of the planet from the sun is 4.4 billion km then write the equation of the

Apply concepts of inverse trigonometric functions to real life word problems, such as
mechanical engineering, architecture to find height of the building, angle of elevation
and depression, identifying the angle of bridges to build scale models.

Inverse Trigonometric Functions play a crucial role in mathematics, particularly in calculus,
geometry, and engineering, by enabling the determination of angles from known trigonometric
function values. These functions are also essential in fields such as physics, engineering, and
computer graphics. They are widely used to solve equations involving trigonometric functions,
analyze periodic phenomena, and develop algorithms for 3D rendering and modeling. A solid
understanding of these functions and their properties allows us to address complex problems in both
theoretical and applied mathematics, making them a powerful tool in any mathematician's toolkit. '

8.1 The Inverse Trigonometric Functions

Inverse trigonometric functions are the inverse operations of basic trigonometric functions
cosine, sine, tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent.
The primary inverse trigonometric functions include:

* ArccosorCos™: _ the inverse of cosine function.
Arcsin or Sin™* _ the inverse of sine function.
Arctan or Tan™* _ the inverse of tangent function.
e ArcsecorSec* _ the inverse of secant function.
e ArccscorCsc™* the inverse of cosecant function. Overlay of all six trigonometric
e ArccotorCot™ _ the inverse of cotangent function. function on one graph

These functions are used to find the angle whose trigonometric function value is given. For
example, if we know that & cosine of an —" is 0.5, we can use the arccosine function to find
the angle which is 60° ors = radians,

8.1.10 The Principal Cotangent Function

To define principal cotangent function, we need an
interval for x where there is only one solution to
cotx = k for k € (—0co, +00). Such a solution is
possible in the interval between 0 and zm. In the
interval (0,77), we can find a unique solution to
the equation Cot x = k, where k € (—00, 00).
We write this solution as x = Cot? k.

The cotangent function defined on x € (0,7) for
which there is only one solution of the equation
Cot x = k where k € (—©9, 00) is called the
Principal Cotangent Function.

Example 4: Find the principal value of Cot~*(—v3) ‘
Solution: Let y = Cot~*(—V3) if and only if Cot y = —V3, where y € (0,7).

where x € (0,7) and f (x) € (—0, +00),

we define an inverse cotangent function

solution to secx = k fork € R — (—1,1), we choose
the interval from 0 to m except = We have an option
to consider an interval x € (1, 277), x # =

or many others. It is a mathematical convention

to choose x € [0, 1], x # =.

--- PAGE 238 ---
In the interval x € [0, z],x # > we can find a
unique solution to the equation Secx = k,
where k € R — (—1, 1). We write this solution
as x = Sec’ k. In other words, “x is a real

secant value is k”. The secant function defined

8.2 Graphs of Inverse Trigonometric Functions

Drawing graphs of trigonometric functions is a fundamental skill. It allows the problem solver to
interpret and understand the relationship visually between two variable quantities. Graphs provide
an intuitive way to analyze the behavior, identify the trend and solve problems.

Graphing becomes valuable in case of inverse trigonometric functions, where the restricted domain
and range were not enough to understand the problem.

Plotting these graphs, we gain insights the characteristics, such as symmetry, continuity, and
asymptotic behavior. Whether it is engineering or navigation, the ability to draw accurately and
interpret graphs of inverse trigonometric functions is essential for solving real-world problems
involving angles and distances.

Properties: .
_* Domain and Range: The domain is (—0o, —1] U [1, 0) and the range is (0,2) U (=, 7].
* Key Points: (—c,*), (—2,4), (1,7), (1,0), (2,2), (+0,4)

Asymptotes: Draw a horizontal asymptote y = 0 approaching the cosecant curve at
x = to,

e Appearance: The cosecant graph appears decreasing from (1,3), moves along the
horizontal asymptote y = 0 and ends at (+00, 0). The cosecant graph appears increasing
from. (-1, - *), moves along the horizontal asymptote y = 0 and ends at (—©, —0).

° Monotonicity: The graph is monotonically increasing and decreasing smoothly (it always
increases/decreases as x increases/increases) along the horizontal asymptote y = 0 .

: ery | (Symmetric about origin)
The symmetry along range [==,5| /{0} shows that graph is reflected across origin.
e Reflection: The graph of y =Csc"*x, is a reflection of y = Csc x across the line y = x.

This means that the x and y coordinates of the points on the graph of y = Csc x are
switched to obtain the points on the graph of y = Csc™*x.
