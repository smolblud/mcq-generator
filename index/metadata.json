Every degree of virtue has a proportionate degree of happiness accompanying it. If we expect too much from life, we cannot be happy. It is only by giving to life what we can best afford, that we can lead a joyous life. Life is not self-aggrandizement. Aself-seeker and selfish man can never do any good to others. It is only by realizing that the needs and desires of others are important and should be addressed. Let us share the sufferings of others if we want to keep away from sorrow. Quest of happiness is a noble pursuit and it is worth striving, no matter how far we succeed. The question arises whether human failure to achieve perfect felicity does not have an injurious effect on character, it is not so; but on the contrary the difficulties and sufferings thatewe undergo in our life, are really blessings in disguise, which help in developing our character. Character, in fact is conquest of the lower self by the upper self in us. Once the character building is done, success and happiness is in easy reach. We must keep in mind that happiness is a condition of the mind. It does not depend on something external. It springs from withing Contentment is the first condition of happiness. Ahappy and congenial life is a source of immeasurable joy and contentment. In such a surrounding, one can find love, trust, and mutual respect form those around.

    "text": "P unit 1 FAMILY VALUES IN PAKISTAN Sentence: A sentence is a set of words that is complete in itself, typically containing a subject and predicate, conveying a statement, question, exclamation, or command, and consisting of a main clause and sometimes one or more subordinate clauses. (Oxford Dictionary). Kinds of sentences: Declarative Sentences A declarative sentence is the most basic type of sentence. Its purpose is to relay information, and it is punctuated with a period. For example The boy walked home. | love honey. Interrogative Sentences Interrogative sentences interrogate, or ask questions. These are direct questions, and they are punctuated with a question mark. For example: Why does the sun shine? Whose dog is that? Will you go to Lahore? Exclamatory Sentences Exclamatory sentences are like declarative sentences. They make a statement instead of asking a question, but their main purpose is to express strong emotion. They have an exclamation point instead of a period. For example: | said | wanted tacos instead of pizza! How well he sings! Wow, he just won a gold medal! Imperative Sentences Imperative sentences do not simply state a fact but rather tell someone to do something. These can be in the form of friendly advice, basic instructions or more forceful commands. For example: Please shut the door to keep out the bugs. Turn left at the bridge. Stop bothering me! Optative Sentences Optative sentences express a prayer, wish, curse, etc.For example: May Allah bless us all. May you become successful in life. Long live Pakistan.

Most clear, dark nights you can see a shooting star, as we call it, if you keep looking. Those shooting stars are meteors. They are points of light that suddenly appear in the sky, like distant stars, race across the darkness, usually towards the horizon, and disappear. For a long time, nobody knew what a meteor was but finally those who studied stars and the sky decided that a meteor was a piece of a comet that exploded long ago. Those piecesare still wandering about the universe in huge, looping paths that follow the original comet's orbit. There are uncounted pieces of such comets out there in the depths of space. Periodically clusters of them come close to the earth's orbit, or path around the sun. Most meteors are small, probably only a few inches in diameter, but when they enter the earth's atmosphere the friction makes them white-hot. Then they look big as stars streaking across the darkness, There are half a dozen meteor showers each year. Each is named after the constellation from which it appears to come. The biggest of all, the Perseids, named for the constellation of Perseus, occurson the 10th, 11th, and 12th of August. The next largest, the Leonidas, named for the constellation of Leo, comes on the nights of November 14, 15) and 16. Another, the Andromedids, which is not quite so big, comes from November 17 to 23.

What are shooting stars? Most people watching meteors will be satisfied if they see ten or twenty in an hour of watching. On special occasions, however, the meteors seem to come in droves. The most remarkable meteor shower 1 ever heard of was seen by a distinguished astronomer, Professor Denison Olmstead, of New Haven, Connecticut, on the night of November 12, 1833. He was watching the Leonidas, which seem to come from directly overhead and race downward toward the horizon in all directions. He reported that-meteors fell \u201clike flakes of snow. \" He estimated that he saw 240, 000 meteors in nine hours that night. He also revealed that they ranged in size from mere streaks of light to \"globes of the moon's diameter. \" If he had not been a notable astronomer whose accuracy was beyond question, such statements would seem ridiculous.

For example: * Strong as an ox * Sweet as sugar * raining like cats and dogs b) Metaphor A metaphor is a comparison between two unlike things. It creates implicit comparisons without the express use of \u201clike\u201d or \u201cas. \"It asserts that two things are identical in comparison rather than similar or using specific images or concepts to state abstract truths. For example: * Time is money. * There is a weight on my shoulder. + Laughter is the best medicine. c) Personification Personification is a figure of speech in which a thing - an idea or an animal - is given human attributes.

Subject: Repair of the road in Rawalpindi Sir, | would like to bring to your notice that the people in and around Rawalpindi have been facing difficulties in travelling back and forth because of the bad condition of the roads there. We have appealed to the Municipality, but there has not been any response on the issue so far. As our appeals to their office have had no effect, we believe that perhaps a mention in the media would be of great help. Since the beginning of the last month, the roads in Rawalpindi have been almost impassable. The surface is badly broken up by the heavy rains, and on a dark night, it is positively dangerous for vehicles to pass that way. Moreover, there are heaps of road metal on both sides of the road, which leave very little room in the middle. The residents of the area have been inconvenienced in this way for weeks. The situation is becoming worse. There have been multiple accidents happening due to this condition. | request you to highlight the seriousness of the matter in your newspaper so that the road may be properly repaired without further delay. Thanking You Yours sincerely, Us AliAhmed Write a letter to newspaper editor and highlight the issue of street crimes in your city."

As a toddler, Kiser was abandoned by his parents and grandparents; he lived in an orphanage in Jacksonville, Florida. He attended school in Jacksonville but only finished up through his sixth-grade year. Kiser dropped out of seventh grade two weeks into the school year. Despite this, he later attended nursing school and worked as both an EMT and LPN in Georgia, then as a medic in the U.S. Army for three years. After working as a nurse for many years, Kiser shifted his work and became an ammunition inspector in California before moving back to Georgia. Kiser\u2019s work is inspired by his life in Jacksonville and the abuse he suffered in both the Children\u2019s Home Society Orphanage and the Florida Industrial School for Boys at Marianna. He started writing because the sorrow and pain he felt due to the abuse he suffered as a child was still such a major part of his life. Writing was difficult because Kiser only had a sixth-grade education, but his storytelling ability shone through. Kiser has written over 900'short stories during his career, many of which have been published in various Chicken Soup for the Soul volumes. He has said his favorite of his own stories is \"A'D' Minus,\u201d while the hardest to write was \"The Horrors in the White House.\u201d www. https: //study.com/learn/lesson/roger-dean-kiser-biography-works.html Theme: This story is about Kiser as a boy in his orphanage that there were butterflies there.

C) Elements of Short Story a) Basic elements of astory There are 5 elements of a story that are typically taught first in elementary school. These story elements are: 1. Setting: Where and when is the story happening? Setting represents both the physical location but also the time (i.e. past, present, future) and the social and cultural conditions in which the characters exist. It can be used to create atmosphere and mood and to influence character behavior and plot development. 2. Character: A person or animal or really anything personified. There can be one main character or many, and they may have a background that has shaped and molded them. Secondary characters are also important . Characters can be described in terms of their physical appearance, personality, background, and motivations. They can also be dynamic (changing) or static (unchanging) throughout the story. 3. Conflict: Every story must have a conflict, i.e. a challenge or problem around which the plot is based. Without conflict, the story will have no purpose. Conflict can take many forms, such as person vs. person, person vs. nature, person vs. society, and person vs. self. The conflict should be well-developed and add tension and drama to the story."

In a plot you typically find an introduction, rising action, a climax, the falling action, and a resolution. Plot is often represented as an arc. The plot is the backbone of the story and provides structure and direction for the narrative. \u2018 5. Theme: Idea, belief, moral, lesson or insight. It's the central argument that the author is trying to make the reader understand. The theme is the \u201cwhy\u201d of the story. Themes can be universal (applicable to all) or specific to a certain culture or time period. They should be explored through the events of the story and can offer insights into human behavior or the human condition. Advanced story elements There are 3 advanced elements of a story that are typically taught in high school. These story elements are: 1. Point-of-view: \u201cWho\u201d\".is telling the story? First person (\u201cI\u201d) or third person (\u201che/she/it\"). Limited (one. character's perspective), multiple (many characters\u2019 perspectives) or omniscient (all knowing narrator). Second person (\u201cyou\u201d) is not often used for writing stories. The choice of point-of-view can greatly impact the reader's experience of the story, and.can affect how they relate to the characters and events. Tone: This is the overall emotional \u201ctone\u201d or meaning of the story. Is it happy, funny, sad, or depressed? There are multiple ways to portray tone including through word and grammar choices, choice of theme, imagery and description, symbolism, and the sounds of the words in combination (i.e. rhyme, rhythm, and musicality). The tone should be consistent throughout the story and should match the mood and atmosphere created by the setting, plot, and characters. Style: This is how things are said. Word"

Billions of people will lack access to these basic services in 2030 unless progress quadruples. Demand for water is rising owing to rapid population growth, urbanization and increasing water needs from agriculture, industry, and energy sectors. The demand for water has outpaced population growth, and half the world\u2019s population is already experiencing severe water scarcity at least one month a year. Water scarcity is projected to increase with the rise of global temperatures as a result of climate change. Investments in infrastructure and sanitation facilities; protection and restoration of water- related ecosystems; and hygiene education are among the steps necessary to ensure universal access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030, and improving water-use efficiency is one key toreducing water stress. There has been positive progress. Between 2015 and 2022, the proportion of the world's population with access to safely managed drinking water increased from 69 per cent to 73 per cent. Why? Access to water, sanitation and hygiene is a human right. To get back on track, key strategies include increasing sector-wide investment and capacity-building, promoting innovation and evidence-based action, enhancing cross-sectoral coordination and cooperation among all stakeholders, and adopting a more integrated and holistic approach to water management.

If your subject line is vague, people may ignore your email, or it may be sent to the junk/spam folder. Greeting Choosing a greeting may appear to be an easy task, but you have to select the appropriate level of formality. Emailing a coworker with whom you are friends to ask a brief question is different from emailing your supervisor with a work-related request. Below are some greetings that straddle different levels of formality: More formal: - Dear [Name], Hello [Name], Good morning/afternoon [Name], Less formal: Hi [Name], Hey [Name], Body Depending on how your audience will react to the information in your email, you will need to decide whether to structure your email body using the direct or indirect method of communication.

    "text": "a __ The Darkling Thrush (Poem) Theme: The main topic of The Darkling Thrush\u2019 is the hopelessness of modern temperament. In the poem, Hardy describes the death of an old world ina lyrical and descriptive way, but he cannot replace it with a new one. Something is finished, everything has changed, civilization is gone, and he does not know what is going to replace it. At first glance, the poem seems to be about change, the passage of time, and seeing things from a different point of view. In The Darkling Thrush\u2019, Thomas Hardy portrays nature as uninterested in the existence of humanity and it is sufferings. The tragedy of the nineteenth century is the loss of hope due to the lack of faith in any other positive force. Summary: The \u2018Darkling Thrush\u2019 is a poem written by Thomas Hardy on December 31st, 1900, the final day of the nineteenth century. The poem is about the despair and hopelessness of the final days of the nineteenth century and the uncertainty of the twenty-first century. The speaker describes a bleak winter landscape, with cold and frost, and the barrenness of the land. The speaker mourns the cruetness of this season and the emptiness of the world. Inthe midst of this bleak landscape, the speaker hears the singing of a thrush perched oma twisted tree. It is a strange and unexpected sound to hear in such a bleak environment, but the thrush\u2019s song is filled with joy and vitality. The speaker is touched by the bird's resilience and the hope it brings to the world, even in the darkest of times.

Instead, it's used to indicate the speaker's attitude and emotions, to tell the difference between statement and question, and to differentiate between different types of question, to focus attention on important parts of the spoken message, and to regulate conversation. This is in contrast to tone, which in some languages uses pitch variation to distinguish words, either word-by-word or sentence- by-sentence (yes/no question, request for repetition, greeting, etc.). In this example, the main movement of the sentence is still at the tone of the Tonic, but this time, the voice descends on the Tonic, then rises.

Adeel entered the home and rushed to his room. Mrs. Imran got a little worried as he hadn't spoken more than few words on their drive back from school. He was usually full of stories and tidbits about what happened in the class and the little mischiefs that his friends were involved in. He was a bright and cheerful boy, always enthusiastic about school, friends, and life in general. What could be the cause? She thought worriedly. It all started innocently enough when Adeel's class fellows accidently got their hands on some embarrassing photos of him from a school farewell party. He was just being a young man having fun. Instead of keeping those to themselves, they decided to share them without his consent. Someone hacked his profile and uploaded the photos. Those images spread like wildfire across social media, followed by cruel and hurtful comments. Adeel was devastated. The once-vibrant boy now felt like a shadow of his former self. He stopped enjoying school, lost interest in football, and withdrew from his friends. Every day was a struggle, as he faced not only the online harassment but also the ridicule and jeering of his classmates in person. Going to school become the most difficult thing for him to do. Things took a darker turn when an elder group of boys at school began to blackmail Adeel, threatening to share even more embarrassing content if he did not comply with their demands. They were asking his lunch, his watch and then money. The weight of it all was crushing, and Adeel sank"

While-reading How did Adeel's silence about his suffering affect the situation? Mrs. Imran kept asking him the reason for this change but Adeel always told her that everything was fine. Mrs. Imran decided to take help from her brother, Muzammil, a wise and caring man. Muzammil took Adeel out for a walk to the nearby park and told him that he got their unwavering support, no matter what the problem was. He assured Adeel that he had the support of the whole family with him. At last, Adeel shared his heartbreaking story, and his uncle listened attentively.

(One clause sentence/ simple sentence) | came here and| saw my friend. (Two clause sentence/compound sentence) When | came here, | saw my friend, and he greeted me. (Three clause sentence/compound-complex sentence) There are two main types of clauses: * Independent Clause * Dependent Clause Independent Clause It functions on its own to make a meaningful sentence and looks much like a regular sentence with a subject+verb+object (SVO) structure. In a sentence two independent clauses can be connected by the coordinators: and, but, so, or, nor, for, yet. Examples: * He is a wise man. * | like him. * Can you do it? + Do it please. (Subject you is hidden) * | read the whole novel. + [want to buy a new dress, but | don\u2019t have enough money. (Two independent clauses) * He went to London and visited the Lords.

    "text": "fF units | Social Media: A Blessing or a Curse? Dependent Clause It cannot function on its own because it leaves an idea or thought unfinished. It is also called a subordinate clause. These help the independent clauses complete the sentence. Alone, it cannot form a complete sentence. Example: When | was returning home, | had an accident. | know the man who stole the watch. He bought a car which was too expensive. | know that he cannot do it. He does not know where he was born. * If you don't eat, | won't go. The subordinators do the work of connecting the dependent clause to another clause to complete the sentence. In each of the dependent clauses, the first word is a subordinator. Subordinators include relative pronouns, subordinating conjunctions, and noun clause markers. Dependent clauses come in three types: noun clauses, relative clauses, and adverb clauses. (Noun clauses replace other nouns in a sentence, but relative and adverb clauses modify words already in the sentence rather than removing and replacing them.) Let's look at relative Clauses in detail. Relative Clauses As can be seen from the examples of dependent clauses above, complex sentences or sentences with one or more dependent clauses are formed principally by means of relative pronouns. Relative clauses give us information.about the person or thing mentioned. The basic relative pronouns are who, which, and that (who also has the derived forms whom and whose). a) Underline the relative clause in each sentence. Encircle the relative pronoun that introduces the clause. i. The book that | got from the library is due tomorrow. ii.

This dual nature highlights the importance of educating individuals especially young people on making informed choices. The causes included inability to say No to friends, peer pressure, stress and anxiety and loneliness. Equipping our youth with strategies to resist peer pressure and develop refusal skills is crucial. Drug education serves as a protective shield against the harmful impact of substance abuse.

They may make a small poster/ infographic and explain it to their class fellows. Vocabulary and Grammar 1. a. Adverb:- As we have studied in earlier grades, an adverb is a word or an expression that modifies a verb, adjective, another adverb, determiner, clause, preposition, or sentence. Example: * The bird sang melodiously. (How?) * He is very careless. (How much?) * They are still playing outside. (Where?) * We are friends and we often meet. (How frequently?) * We need to plant these trees in the morning. (When?) Adverbs typically express manner, place, time, frequency, degree, level of certainty, etc., answering questions such as how?, in what way?, when?, where?, and to what extent?. This is called the adverbial function, and may be performed by single words (adverbs) or by multi-word adverbial phrases and adverbial clauses. b. Types of Adverbs: Sometimes, recently, 1. 1 used to go out for refreshments. Adverbs during, always, soon, yet, 2: gece purchased a costly Diamond of Time usually, never, etc. 3.

In sentence (a), the plan was to go on strike but something happened and the plan was immediately called off.

Example: his oan Wes eutdrg BOUT Pe son. The woman said that her husband was not feeling well. The players were concerned about their performance. The word \u201cantecedent\u201d means something that precedes something else. In language, it is the word that.a pronoun refers back to. Since the pronoun replaces the noun, it has to agree in number, So, if the antecedent, or word that comes before, is singular, then the pronoun that takes its place must also be singular. It can be confusing if there are several words between the pronoun and its antecedent. These words or clauses have no bearing onthe words and they need to be ignored. Following are some special situations with examples of the correct way to have pronoun antecedent agreement. a) Singular Indefinite Pronouns The singular indefinite pronouns take a singular antecedent. They refer to a single unspecified person or thing or to one collective group. Examples: Each of these gadgets has its own pros and cons. Everybody came in his or her car. b) Indefinite Pronouns The plural indefinite pronouns which include: several, few, both, many, and others are always plural in context, and would always require plural pronouns. Examples: Several applicants submitted their application for the vacancy. Few of us have contacted our sponsors. c) Two nouns or Pronouns Joined by \u2018and\u2019 When faced with an antecedent that consists of two nouns or pronouns joined by the word and, the principle is to use a plural pronoun.

The Small Woman: The Heroic Story of Gladys bial The Chinese Nationalist officer was \u2014 commanding the platoon. Scouting on the wrong side of the river, he looked back at the section of men straggling along behind him. His wandering thoughts suddenly jarred to a standstill. A noise! An odd noise! A far-off, high pitched sound, wavering and uncertain. A plane? His men thought so. He watched them rolling their eyes round the cloudless sky in an effort to locate it. There had been an unusual air activity up-and down the Yellow River for the past week. Usually the Japanese planes patrolled and fired at anything that moved. And yet this sounded almost high and momentous. He shook his head as though to clear it. The river at this point was a mile wide; there might be children left in the village on the other side of the river. Perhaps they were at school; but their voices carry this far. He mounted a slight rise, crawling carefully on the top. He raised himself to see better, and grunted in astonishment. He reached for his binoculars and focused. It was an astonishing sight. A great crowd of eo children were assembled on the bank, all seated in a What i gs ale in the/platoon circle and singing loudly. Some smaller ones were splashing and jumping in the shallows.

The poem expresses how Tennyson uses these elements to express his grief. Theme: Break Break Break is a short poem with an overridingly sad and nostalgic tone. The poem presents a sea-side image, complete with a wild sea, playing children, fishermen, sailors and sailing boats in the background of majestic ships. Tennyson subtlety juxtaposes these elements with the sense of impermanence on the death of a beloved friend Speaker: The poet himself is the narrator Poetic form: This poem is broken into four stanzas each of which is a quatrain. Each quatrain is further broken down according to its rhyme scheme; ABCB where the second and fourth lines always rhyme.

Alfred Lord Tennyson interjection: - An interjection is a word or phrase that mainly expresses spontaneous or abrupt feeling or emotion They can show happiness, surprise, anger, stress, impatience, fright or hatred etc. While interjections are a part of speech but they are er independent.

    "text": "F unit 12 BREAK BREAK BREAK (POEM) Types of Interjections Primary interjections A primary interjection is a word or sound that can only be used as an interjection. Primary interjections do not have alternative meanings and can't function as another part of speech (i.e., noun, verb or adjective). Primary interjections are typically just sounds without a clear etymology. As such, while they sometimes have standard spellings, a single interjection may be written in different ways (e.g., \u201cum-hum\u201d or \u201cmm-hmm\u201d). Examples: Primary interjections in a sentence Ugh! That's disgusting. Um-hum! | think that could work. We won the game. Yippee! Secondary interjections A secondary interjection is a word that is typically used as another part of speech (such as a noun, verb, or adjective) that can also be used as an interjection. Examples: Secondary interjections in a sentence Goodness! That was a close one. Shoot! My flight has been canceled. \u2018 Awesome! Do that trick again. Volitive interjections A volitive interjection is used to give a command or make a request. For example, the volitive interjection \u201cshh\u201d or \u201cshush\u201d is used to command someone to be quiet. Examples: Volitive interjections in a sentence Shh! | can't focus when you're singing. Psst! Pass me an eraser. Ahem! Please pay attention. Emotive interjections An emotive interjection is used to express an emotion or to indicate a reaction to \u2018something. For example, the emotive interjection \u201cew\u201d is used to express disgust. Curse words, also called expletives, are commonly used (in informal contexts) as emotive interjections to express frustration or anger. Examples: Emotive interjections in a sentence Ew! I'm not eating that. ee en ee eee MS ade GG ae ee 147 DO"

Cognitive interjections A cognitive interjection is used to express a thought or indicate a thought process. For example, the cognitive interjection \u201cum\u201d can express confusion or indicate that the speaker is thinking. Examples: Cognitive interjections in a sentence ~> - Um! can you. explain it once more? Wow! | wasn't expecting that. Eureka! I've solved the puzzle. Greetings and parting words Greetings and parting words/phrases are interjections used to acknowledge or welcome someone\u2019or to \u00e9xpress good wishes at the end of a conversation. Examples: Greetings and partirig words/phrases in a sentence Hey! How's life? Hello! It's good to see you. Bye! See you later! See you soon! Drive safe. Interjections and punctuation How an interjection is punctuated depends gn the context and the intensity of the emotion or thought being expressed. Exclamation points are most commonly used along with interjections to emphasize the intensity of an emotion, thought, or demand. When the emotion or thought being expressed is less extreme, an interjection can also be followed by a period. If an interjection is used to express uncertainty or to ask a question, it should be followed by a question mark. Examples: Interjections and punctuation Oh! | don't know. We've just won the lottery. Hurray! Are you done .Hmm? When an interjection is used as part of a sentence, it should be set off from the . ~~"

He is often called England's national poet and the \u201cBard of Avon. His extent works, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. They also continue to be studied and reinterpreted. Theme:\u201c This poem reflects the harm and misery those closest to us can inflict. Betrayal, fake friendship and bitter realities of human relations are the major themes of the poem. Throughout the poem the speaker compares the harsh winter with the negative behavior of mankind .Forhim the harsh winter is less cruel than the cruelity of men. Context: Blow, Blow, thou winter wind\u201d is a poem from the Shakespeare's play \u2018As You Like It.'which is a song sung by Amiens ,a lord and follower of Duke Senior in the play .In the song Amiens compares the harshness of the west wind to the ungraefulness of human beings, finding the latter to be much more kind . This poem is an example of a type of figurative language called personification. Shakespeare reveals his true poem with the line \u201cMost friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.\u201dby looking down at man\u2019s ingratitude and the idea that humans are two-faced.

Note the expressions of the poet in this poem while reciting it. They indicate the betrayal, fake friendship and bitter realities of human life. * Discuss the various interpretations of the poem highlighting its imagery, symbols, atmosphere and tone within groups. Figures of Speech: The poem abounds in the usage of figures of speech.A figure of speech is an expression used to make a greater effect on your reader or listener. It is a form of expression (such as a simile or metaphor) used to convey meaning or heighten effect often by comparing or identifying one thing with another that has a meaning or connotation familiar to the reader or listener.\u201d It also gives a much clearer picture of what you are trying to convey. Metaphor: A metaphor is a figure of speech that is used to make a comparison, but in a way different from a simile. Instead, it makes the description of an object look as if it was literally true. In other words, it can be said that a metaphor is an implied comparison She's the man of the house! What do you think the above sentence implies? The \u2018woman\u2019 is being called the \u2018man\u2019 to draw a parallel with the idea of taking all the responsibility and being the bread earner in the house.

It is pointless to remain in a profession that does not allow us to improve ourselves professionally because we have only one lifetime to use our potential and become the person that we wish to be. To find out more about the type of prospects that a profession might offer, we should do ample research and talk to those who are already employed in our field of interest. Well you have a lot of information. Let me continue. Fourthly, salary, location and the number of working hours per week. These must be prioritized when choosing a profession. These factors must be balanced with travel requirements and family life. Oh! Are these points enough? No, the last point is the skill and commitment, for you the skills set and how to gain those\u2019through education must be considered when choosing a new profession. For instance, becoming a doctor requires extensive education and training. In addition this professional field requires an 8-years long educational commitment You really have given me lots of information. | will follow your advice Insha'Allah before choosing a profession. Thank you. My pleasure, dear friend."

Such words which are formed:by adding \u2018ing\u2019 to the first form of the verb are called Participles. The word participle comes from classical Latin participium, from particeps \u2018sharing, participation\u2019, because it shares certain properties of verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Present participles can be used as adjectives, as part of participial phrases, and to form continuous verb tenses. For example:- Base Verb: Sneeze Present Participle: Sneezing Types of participle 1) Present participle: The present participle is often used when we want to express an active action.

    "text": "F cunit 14 | CHOICE OF A PROFESSION Verb Tense Consistency. Verb tense consistency refers to keeping the same tense throughout a clause. If you | have two or more time periods, start a new clause or a new sentence. Let's consider an _ example:-_ Ali finished his essay, tidied his room, and went out for supper. Finished and went are in past tense, but tidies is in present tense. Logistically, this can't happen. We could fix this in a couple of different ways: Ali finished his essay, tidied his room, and went out for supper. Ali finished his essay and went out for supper, and now he is tidying his room. I'm eating the cake which | made this morning. The verb tense consistency in this sentence is logical, as the cake must be made before it can be eaten. Still, we use two clauses toshow the different tenses. In the dialogue above consistent verb tenses are used which clearly establish the time of the actions being described. It is vital to use the same tense throughout a writing unless it is necessary to show an event that occurred at a different time. Do not shift tenses unnecessarily."

    "text": "F unit 15] The Ninny (Short Story), Anton Chekhov Se oe ee a Oral Communication Atmosphere or Mood of AStory Atmosphere is the emotional tone of a literary work. It determines an emotional mood to the readers, whether happy or (more commonly) terrifying or disastrous. For example, Shakespeare establishes the tense and fearful atmosphere at the beginning of the play Hamlet by the terse and nervous dialogue of the sentinels as they anticipate a reappearance of the ghost. Coleridge engenders a compound of religious and superstitious terror by his description of the initial scene in the narrative poem Christabel (1816). Alternative terms frequently used for atmosphere are mood and ambience. The mood is the feeling that the writer tries to evoke in the readers e.g., anxiety, calmness, anger or joy. It's maintained through settings, tone, word choice, theme, or subject matter in a story. Setting refers to the physical location in a narrative. Tone determines the attitude of the narrator. Words with negative or positive connotations evoke particular feelings, and subject matter or theme also creates sad or happy mood respectively. Most often, the words which are used to describe emotion can be used to describe the mood of a story. Gloomy, humorous, reflective, idyllic, melancholy, ominous, mysterious, calm, lonely, exciting and fearful are some common words used to describe mood in a piece of Literature. Discuss the mood of the story in group by stgting setting, tone, word choice and theme of the story. Afterwards, each group leader must share his/her the views of the group . with the rest of the class.

A long table running from left to right, witha chair at each end and six chairs on each side, is set elaborately for fourteen.

She is rather excitable in temperament but withal capable and executive, vivacious and humorously charming.

CURTAIN Alice Gerstenberg was born in Chicago, the only child of Julia and Erich Gerstenberg. Gerstenberg's grandfather was a founder and member of the Chicago Board of Trade in 1848, a position Gerstenberg's father inherited later, which meant that the Gerstenbergs enjoyed a higher standard of living than most middle-class families in Chicago at the time. Growing up, Gerstenberg had ample travel experiences and social indulgences including commercial theater. She attended a private school in Chicago and later graduated from Bryn Mawr, a women's college in Pennsylvania, in 1907. After college, she spent some time in New York watching the rehearsals of David Belasco before returning home to Chicago. Fourteen is a play by Alice Gerstenberg. This one- | act social satire was first performed October 7, 1919 at the Maitland Playhouse, 332 Stockton Street, San Francisco, on.a bill with three other one-act plays. Mrs. Pringle is preparing to host a dinner party to introduce her daughter, Elaine, to the city\u2019s most eligible bachelor, Oliver Farnsworth.

They must follow intonation patterns during dialogue delivery. \u00a2 Work in small groups to review the play. Take time to offer suggestions and reasons for improvement. * Do you think the dialogues provide necessary information about the characters and the situation? Exchange views about it. * The play becomes more forceful because the two characters are speaking directly to one another. Opportunity should be provided to stage the play with the help of the teacher. Vocabulary and Grammar Tenses: - Verbs come in three tenses: past, present, and future. The past is used to describe things that have already happened (e. g. , earlier in the day, yesterday, last week, three years ago). The present tense is used to describe things that are happening right now, or things that are continuous. a. Simple Present The simple present is the most basic way to say something in the present tense. We use it to talk about more general things that we do often or regularly, or to state simple facts: To use the simple present, we don't always need helping verbs. Simple present sentence follows the pattern Subject + Present Verb. | work at the mail. They eat waffles for breakfast every day! Irha likes candy. a ea Pe"

Present Continuous The present continuous tense describes actions and/or events that are currently happening or going on now; in other words, things that are continuing to happen right now in \u201creal time. \u201d To do that, we use a verb ending in ing. Sentences in the present continuous follow the Subject + Verb to be + ing Verb pattern: Eshaal is listening to music. | am eating a cheeseburger. The dogs are barking loudly. c. Present Perfect We use the present perfect tense to share something that happened before, but is still relevant-or important now. To use it, we always place the auxiliary have before the main verb, which shows that we \u201chave done it,\u201d and it should be followed by the past-tense form of the main verb. It may seem confusing that even though we use a past verb, it's still the present tense\u2014remember, we are showing that something already happened, but still matters now! As you know, the past form of regular verbs ends in ed, but irregular verbs have different forms. A sentence in the siaiaaales perfect should follow Subject + Have/Has + Past form of main verb: Ali has traveled to \u2014 but she really wants to go Venice. They have lived in that house for 10 years. d. Present Perfect Continuous The present perfect continuous expresses actions (or events) that we have been doing and are still doing.

Reading IN ASMALL PART OF THE CITY WEST OF Washington Square, the streets have gone wild. They turn in different directions. They are broken into small pieces called \u201cplaces.\u201d One street goes across itself one or two times. A painter once discovered something possible and valuable about this street. Suppose a he had not paid. Suppose he had no money. Suppose a man came to get the money. The man might walk down that street and suddenly meet himself coming back, without having received a cent! This part of the city is called Greenwich Village. And to old Greenwich Village the painters soon came. Here they found rooms they like, with good light and at a low cost. Sue and Johnsy lived at the top of a building with. three floors. One of these young women came from Maine, the other from California. They had met at a restaurant on Eighth Street. There they discovered that they liked the same kind of art, the same kind of food, and the same kind of clothes. So, they decided to live and work together. That was in the Spring. Towards winter a cold stranger entered Greenwich Village. No one could see him. He walked around touching one person here and another there with his icy fingers. He was a bad sickness. Doctors called him Pneumonia. On the east side of the city he hurried, touching many people; but in the narrow streets of Greenwich Village, he did not move so quickly.

Past Perfect The past perfect tense describes something that we have done before, but also matters now. We use it toclarify that one event happened before another event in the past. To use the past perfect, we need the auxiliary had before the main verb to show that we \u201chad done\u201d something. Then, we need to add the main verb, in its past-tense form.

She had no dowry, no expectations, no means of becoming known, understood, loved or wedded by a man of wealth and distinction; and so, she let herself be married to a minor official at the Ministry of Education.

Women don't belong to a caste or class; their beauty, grace, and natural charm take the place of birth and family. Natural delicacy, instinctive elegance and a quick wit determine their place in society and make the daughters of commoners the equals of the very finest ladies. She suffered endlessly, feeling she was entitled to all the delicacies and luxuries of life. She suffered because of the poorness of her house as she looked at the dirty walls, the worn-out chairs and the ugly curtains.

    "text": "Types of Future Tenses a. Simple Future You can use the simple future to talk about something (like an action or event) that will happen any time in the future, and also to talk about something that will happen one time. In the simple future, we use the base form of the verb with a modal auxiliary, like will. So, the simple future follows the form Subject + modal + Base Verb. | will eat a cheeseburger for dinner. Jane might buy a new car tomorrow. b, Future Continuous The future continuous tense talk about things will be happening continuously in the future. To show this, we use a modal, the verb to be, and a verb ending in ing. Sentences in the future continuous tense follow the Subject + modal + Verb to be + ing Verb model: Zara will be driving to work. | will be running; the race at 6pm. The dogs will be barking loudly when you arrive. c. Future Perfect The future perfect tense shows that an event will have happened before another thing in the future. It often expresses that by the time one action or event happens, another will have happened. To use the future perfect, we need to place the modal will and the auxiliary have before the.past form of the main verb (this shows that we \u201cwill have done\u201d an action). Using a past verb in the future tense may seem confusing, but remember, it's to show that something will have happened before another thing, so we need it! So, a sentence written in the future perfect should follow the Subject + will + have + Past form of main verb pattern: Faiza will have traveled the world by the time she turns 30. They will have lived in 10 states"

They will have lived in 10 states once they move to New York. He will have taken the exam already, so he won't need to study more. d- Future Perfect Continuous The future perfect continuous describes events and/or actions that have been going on continuously until a certain time in the future. Often, it's used to show cause and effect; in other words, because one thing will have been happening, another will happen. To use it, we need to combine have and been with the continuous form of the verb (ending in ing), this shows that the action or event \u201cwill have been\u201d happening. A sentence in the future perfect continuous follows Subject + modal + have been + ing Verb: Mother will have been working for 12 hours, so | don't think she will want to cook. | should have been watering the plants every day; | hope they won't die. They will have been living in that house for 10 years this March. He will have been driving since noon, so he will need a rest."

These are story elements giving you insight to a previous moment or experience. Standing on the edge of the cliff, she was suddenly transported back to the time when she was two. She remembered the feeling of her heart pounding as she looked down at the ground, seconds before falling. Tone Has anyone ever reprimanded you for your tone? Tone tells us a lot about what a character is thinking, or the feeling the poem is trying to portray. It can be a happy, energetic, or even melancholy tone. The exhilarated girl danced along the sidewalk making her way to her friend's house. (upbeat, happy tone) Alliteration A type of repetition, alliteration is when a letter is used repeatedly to add emphasis and interest to a work. For example: Sleepy sheep were shorn on Sunday. The big black bear banged blandly on the bark. Symbolism Symbolism is a fun literary technique. Writers use this to add meaning to an object or person within a story. Depending on the writer's creativity, the level of symbolism can be basic or unique. For example: In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the scar on/his forehead symbolizes not only his past but his future. Plot Twist Plot twist is a literary technique that introduces a radical.change in the direction or expected outcome of e plot in a work of fiction. When it peppens near the end of a story, it is known as a twist or surprise ending. - Exploit the text of the story \u201cThe Necklace\u201d to find examples of symbolism and irony. + Find examples of alliteration in \u201cThe Necklace\u201d. \u00ab"

As Pakistan's population surges past 240 million, the nation grapples with a demographic crisis demanding urgent reforms to stave off the looming threats of poverty and inequality. Imagine a world with just five billion people. It was on July 11, 1987, when this milestone was reached, marking the first World Population Day (WPD). Fast forward to 2023, and our planet now teems with a staggering eight billion inhabitants. This explosive growth shines a light on the pressing challenges and opportunities that come with such a rapidly expanding global population, impacting sustainable development, health, and well-being. In the heart of this numerical growth lies South Asia, home to over 2.2 billion people. Among these nations, India leads with a population of 1.4 billion, followed by Pakistan's 240 million, and Bangladesh's 172 million. These figures are not just numbers; they are the pulse of a region undergoing significant demographic shifts, demanding urgent and effective policies to manage these changes. Pakistan, in particular, faces an astounding scenario. The quality of human resources is under strain, resources are stretched thin to meet the growing demands, and the nation remains vulnerable to extremism and climate change shocks. Literally speaking over population arises when the resources in a country fall short of meeting the needs of its people. Since its inception Pakistan had to face the problems of illiteracy, poverty, pollution, unemployment, lawlessness and terrorism, inflation, loans, corruption, defective tax structure, government instability and many more serious threats. Unless we control our population increase, these elated problems will not be easily solved. From 2010 to 2015, Pakistan's population increase rate stood 69pc higher than that of Turkey, Iran, India, Indonesia,"

Today, its increase rate of 3.6 remains the highest in South Asia, painting a rather bleak picture of its demographic reality. It is, therefore, imperative to scrutinise policies that have failed to curb skyrocketing population growth. Even after 74 years of its growth, Pakistan is still struggling to find a respectable place in the comity of nations. All the efforts made in the past seem to have gone in vain. Every sector of life today tells a sorry tale. The problem that could be blamed for this bad state of affairs is over population in the country. Over population emerges as the main villain in Pakistan for a number of reasons. Pakistan's progress, though commendable, is a tale of uneven strides. While-reading How does population arise? 22"

    "text": "Birth rate is the most common indicator that the countries today use to keep a check on over population. Pakistan today suffers from a high birth rate in the country and we must be mindful of it. Aserious thought should be given today to the factors which have translated the high birth rate into over population. The advancements in the medical field have led to a sharp decline in the death rate. The life expectancy has increased due to the use of improved health technologies. So the decline in death rate has in other words led to the problem of over population. Pakistan is a developing country and like many other countries, it is trying hard to survive in the developed world. A huge population of over 180 million that could have been an asset, is today a huge liability. Fast increasing population is thus a source of constant danger to Pakistan. Over population has badly hampered the economic growth in the country. This leads to a decline in the purchasing power of the people. As the demand for the goods decreases, then by \u201cdemand and supply\u201d law, the investment in the country also suffers. Such a stagnant economy will lead to Closing of factories and businesses, and in return add to joblessness and poverty. Even if the country is somehow successful in attracting foreign investments, still over population will not allow these investments to have a positive effect on country\u2019s economy. Greater population means a greater number of hungry souls to feed. Agriculture is also adversely affected by the rapid increase of over population. More population means smaller farms, and leads to a decline in productivity. People having small farms have no choice but to migrate in hope of a better life. This leads to urbanization, which itself is"

People having small farms have no choice but to migrate in hope of a better life. This leads to urbanization, which itself is a major problem. Many social evils like lawlessness, crime and corruption are all the result of over population. The fight over resources has divided the society into two groups i.e. those who have all and are not willing to share it and second group that is fighting for its mere survival. The fight between haves and have-nots has the seeds of conflict in it, which, if erupted could imperil the peace and order in society. Over population has also contributed to toxic pollution. A greater number of vehicles on the roads means the emitting of poisonous gas for people to inhale. Sewage problem and lack of clean drinking water can also be attributed to the population problem. Proper measures and decisions should be taken to ensure increase in our literacy rate. In 2016- 17, 13.7pc of children aged 10-17 were trapped in child labour, as reported by the International Labour Organisation. What's more alarming is that 5.4pc of these children were engaged in hazardous work which endangered their lives and futures, This exploitation isn't just a tragedy for the children \u2014 it\u2019s a ticking time bomb for the country\u2019s workforce \u2014 setting the stage for a generation of illiterate and unskilled laborers.

This precarious situation heightens disappointment and fuels hatred. The role of media can help a lot in bringing awareness among masses. With most of the population of illiterate people, electronic media can prove to be a huge success in getting the message across. Print media too needs to emphasize the problem of over population on a more regular basis. According to a report by Population Action International Washington, a great reason for population increase in Pakistan is that the Government has made a very insignificant investment in social sector. It is a very serious problem because it leads to frustration, which means chaos. Chaos means danger to state. The problem must be tackled pragmatically. Otherwise our dream of a bright and glorious future will just remain a wish. Astrong Pakistan should be our top priority, and if we have to make certain hard decisions, no one should hesitate to co-operate. Pakistan comes first even before our personal vested interests.

Why are the parts of speech important? These building blocks allow us to construct sentences and communicate complete ideas. Each part of speech plays a specific role. They also unlock more advanced grammar and writing concepts. As we move into a little bit more advanced English lessons about sentence structure, we will start to discuss the different types of sentences, like complex sentences, simple sentences, and compound sentences. It also includes how to identify the direct object and indirect object of a sentence. There is also a difference between an independent clause and a dependent clause and a difference between a main verb and a helping verb. This might all seem like boring grammar topics now, but learning all of these building blocks will make your life so much easier when you try to speak and write fluently in English. Proper sentence structure The order words appear in a sentence depends on their part of speech. Knowing if a word is a noun, verb, adjective, etc. allows you tostructure sentences properly. For example, English sentences often follow a subject-verb-object order. The subject is usually a noun or pronoun, the verb is an action word, and the object receives the action. Parts of speech tell you which words play those roles. Using the right sentence structure makes your writing clear, coherent, and easy to understand. Correct punctuation Punctuation like periods, commas, and semicolons belong in certain places around parts of speech. For instance, commas go between items in a list of adjectives. Periods indicate the end of a sentence containing a"

Clearly state your position and support it with evidence or logical reasoning. e Use examples and illustrations: Real-world, scenarios or data can make your argument more relatable and impactful. 3. Building on Ideas Through Collaboration: \u00a2 Find common ground: Look for areas of agreement, even if minor. This can help establish a sense of teamwork in exploring the issue. \u00a2 Explore solutions together: Instead of simply opposing each other, see if you can brainstorm solutions that address both perspectives. This collaborative approach can lead to more creative and nuanced solutions. 4. Maintaining Respectful Discourse: e Focus on ideas, not personalities: Even when disagreeing, avoid personal attacks or insults. Critique the argument, not the person making it. \u00a2\u00ab Acknowledge limitations: Be open to the possibility that you might not have all the answers. Show your willingness to learn from others. e Use a professional tone: This means avoiding overly emotional language or dismissive phrases. Additional Considerations: \u00a2 Consider the context: The level of formality and the specific topic will influence your communication style. \u00ae Be mindful of nonverbal cues: Maintain eye contact, use open body language, and avoid interrupting to establish rapport and show you're engaged. \u00b0 Ask clarifying questions: If something is unclear, don't hesitate to ask for clarification.

Fitzgerald's version often focused on themes of mortality, the transience of life, and the pursuit of pleasure in the face of uncertainty. Fitzgerald's translation gained recognition and acclaim over time, eventually becoming one of the most widely read and celebrated English translations of Persian poetry. It has been appreciated for its beautiful language, evocative imagery, and thought-provoking themes. Edward Fitzgerald's translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam remains influential and continues to be studied and enjoyed by readers around the world. Theme The main theme revolves around the short-lived and fleeting nature of life, the inevitability of death, and the pursuit of pleasure and knowledge.

Religious belief about life is also there, presenting humans as helpless. Our deeply held beliefs about God and heaven have also been focused. It contains pithy observations on love, death, fate and the existence of God and the afterlife. The poem remains a timeless work of literature that invites readers to ponder the mysteries of life, love, and the transient nature"

Paraphrasing Skills To paraphrase a poem means to rewrite the poem using your own words. A paraphrased poem is not a summary. Instead, you are going through the poem line by line and rewriting each line completely in your own words. Be careful not to simply substitute synonyms. That is not true paraphrasing. Paraphrasing skills are all about expressing someone else\u2019s ideas in your own words. It's a superpower for writers because it lets you avoid plagiarism and showcase your understanding of a topic. Here are some tips to sharpen your paraphrasing skills: e Grasp the meaning first: Before you rewrite, make sure you understand the original content thoroughly. e Thesaurus time: Synonyms are your friends! Swap out words with similar meanings while keeping the core idea intact. e Sentence makeover: Play with sentence structure. Change active voice to passive or vice . versa. Break up long sentences or combine short ones for a fresh look. e Mix and match: Don't be afraid to combine techniques. Use synonyms, change sentence structure, and maybe even reorder the information to create a truly unique paraphrase. * Double check: After paraphrasing, compare it to the original to ensure you've captured the essence without copying.

Carbon monoxide is the harmful gas that replaces part of the oxygen in blood. The oxygen level n a smoker's blood is lowered by this poisonous gas. Tar damages lung tissues. It affects the hair like parts of cells, called cilia that line the breathing tubes. By moving back and forth, the cilia sweep dust and particles out of the lungs to the throat and mouth so they can be breathed or coughed out. When tar from cigarette smoke builds up in the lungs, it forms a sticky brown mass which slows down the action of the cilia. Smoking one pack of cigarettes every day puts a cup of tar into the lungs each year. Cigarette smoke also causes a lung disease known as chronic bronchitis. It occurs when smoke irritates the lining of the bronchial tubes, making them produce too much mucus. The mucus blocks the air tubes, and a person with bronchitis coughs a lot to get rid of it. As tar builds up on the walls of the air tubes and lungs over the years, it can cause cancer cells to grow. Cancer cells multiply and destroy the healthy cells, and after sometime the lungs will not function correctly. The only way to treat lung cancer is to remove all or part of the diseased lung. This type of cancer is the second highest cause of death among people who smoke. Non-smokers rarely get cancer.

    "text": "\u201c7 Figures of Speech in the Poem The Sea\u201d uses a number of figures of speech to bring the sea to life. Here are some of the most notable: \u00a2 Metaphor: The most prominent figure of speech in the poem is the metaphor that compares the sea to a dog. The poem speaks of the sea's \u201cteeth,\u201d its \u201chunger,\u201d and how it \u201cmoans\u201d and \u201chowls.\u201d This metaphor helps the reader to imagine the sea as a powerful and sometimes dangerous creature. Personification: In addition to the metaphor, the poem also uses personification to give the sea human-like qualities. The sea is said to be \u201crestless,\u201d \u201ccalm,\u201d and \"at peace.\u201d These qualities are not things that the sea literally possesses, but they help the reader to understand the different moods of the sea. Onomatopoeia: The poem uses onomatopoeia to create sounds associated with the sea. Words like \u201crumbling,\u201d \u201ctumbling,\u201d \u201cclashing,\u201d \u201cmoans,\u201d and \u201chowls\u201d all help the reader to hear the waves crashing, the wind blowing, and the sea itself making noises. Simile: The poem also uses a simile to compare the calm sea to a dog that is \u201cquiet, so quiet, hardly snoring.\u201d This simile helps to reinforce the image of the sea as a peaceful creature. Nuances It refers to the subtle differences and layers of meaning that can be found in something. It adds depth and complexity to communication. Here are some key things to remember about nuances: e Subtlety: Nuances are not always obvious. They're the hidden details, the slight variations in tone, or the underlying meanings that might not be immediately apparent. Importance: Even though they're subtle, nuances can be very important. They can shape how we understand something, how we react to it, and the overall impression we get. Across Different Fields: Nuances exist in many"

    "text": "the slight variations in tone, or the underlying meanings that might not be immediately apparent. Importance: Even though they're subtle, nuances can be very important. They can shape how we understand something, how we react to it, and the overall impression we get. Across Different Fields: Nuances exist in many areas beyond language. You can find nuances in art, music, emotions, social interactions, and even physical movements. A painter might use subtle color variations to convey a mood, or a musician might play a note with a slight bend to create a specific feeling. Nuances in the poem \u201cThe Sea\u201d There are some interesting nuances in James Reeves\u2019 Duality of the Sea: The poem portrays the sea with a fascinating duality. It's a \"hungry dog\u201d with \u201cteeth,\u201d suggesting danger and power. Yet, it can also be \u201ccalm\u201d and \u201cat peace,\u201d a source of tranquility. This reflects the sea's ability to be both beautiful and destructive, a force that both inspires awe and caution. \u00a9 Shifting Moods: Tiie poem doesn't present the sea in a static state. Through the use of verbs like \u201crestless,\u201d \u201ccalm,\u201d and \"roaring,\" it captures the sea's ever-changing moods. This dynamism reflects the unpredictable nature of the sea, constantly moving and responding to external forces."

This creates a sense of potential within the calmness, a hint that the tranquility might not be permanent. * Open-ended interpretation: The poem doesn't explicitly state the speaker's relationship with the sea.

The exhilarating and rousing effect of his sania was always responded with cheers and applause by the public. He addressed the nation after Germany surrendered in 1945, by saying, \u201cThis is your victory\u2019. The people replied, \u201cNo, it is yours\u201d. Such was the relationship of the public and their wartime leader. He was awarded the Nobel prize in literature in 1953 for his many published works. On 24\" January, 1965 his ailing heath took a toll on him and he passed away. Six sovereigns, 15 heads of state and almost 6000 people attended his state funeral."

    "text": "Theme : The main theme explored in \"First Year at Harrow\u201d by Sir Winston Churchill is the experience of a young boy entering a prestigious boarding school and the challenges of adapting to a new environment. Here are some key aspects of the theme: Culture Shock: Churchill, a young and somewhat sheltered boy, finds himself in a world of strict discipline, rigorous academics, and a social hierarchy different from anything he's known. Self-discovery: Through his struggles and triumphs at Harrow, Churchill begins to understand his strengths and weaknesses, forming the foundation for his future character. Finding One's Place: The'essay explores the anxieties and uncertainties of fitting in at a new school, making friends, and finding a sense of belonging. The value (or lack thereof) of traditional education: Churchill reflects on the emphasis on classics like Latin and Maths, which he disliked, contrasting it with his own interests in history and storytelling. The theme can also be seen through the lens of perseverance and overcoming adversity. Despite his initial struggles, Churchill eventually finds his footing at Harrow, demonstrating the importance of resilience in the face of challenges.

An international team of astronomers has discovered a planet slightly larger than Jupiter that orbits a star 500 light years from Earth. A super-duper telescope was not even required; they found the planet using several small telescopes much like those used by amateur astronomers. The new planet is named TrES-2 because it is the second such planet found by scientists working on the Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey (TrES). It is a transiting planet, meaning it can be seen transiting, or moving, across the star it orbits. Ted Dunham, an instrument scientist at Arizona's Lowell Observatory, says transiting planets are special because researchers can answer a lot of questions about them. All it takes is some math and some observations about the planet and its relationship to its star. Some key questions: How big is it? How long is it's year (the time it takes to orbit around its star)? How much would you weigh if you were there? \u201cTrES-2 is a little bigger than Jupiter, has a \u2018year\u2019 that is a little less than two and a half days, and isa little more massive than Jupiter,\u201d explains Dunham.

That's larger than the surface area of North America. The hole is also the deepest ever recorded. Two things account for the record-breaking hole. The first is that even though more than 180 countries agreed to phase out ODS use in 1987, there are still a lot of these substances up in the stratosphere from years past. That's because they last a long, long time, some of them more than a hundred years. The second factor has to do with clouds and cold temperatures over the South Pole. \u201cThe polar stratosphere is a very cold, dry place,\u201d explains Newman. \u201cIt is hard for clouds to form there. But polar stratospheric clouds form when it gets extremely cold: minus 109 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 78 degrees Celsius).\u201d Newman says that\u2019s when some interesting chemistry takes place: \u201cThe cloud releases chlorine in a form that rapidly destroys ozone.\u201d The good news, however, is that the situation would be a lot worse if people hadn't started doing things to protect the ozone layer. By the year 2070, the big ozone holes will be a thing of the past, predicts Newman. \u00a9 Post-reading How do polar stratospheric clouds form?

The favourite route is through Abbotabad, the administrative capital of the valley. It takes an hour from Abbotabad to Mansehra and the \u2014 road is good. Short of Mansehra the road splits---the left goes to Shinkiari valley, and onwards to Gilgit---the right fork goes through the city of Mansehra.and then on to Balakot, an hour away. Balakot is the gateway to the Kaghan valley. Balakot was the epicentre of the devastating earthquake that struck in 2005. It completely destroyed the town of Balakot, killing thousands of people and also ccripletely destroying the road to Kaghan. Massive amounts of national and international aid was arranged to rehabilitate the affected families and the newly constructed shops and houses are now spread all over the valley. Naran is the most popular destination for the tourists, It is located at an altitude of 7000 feet and is therefore cool in summer. The valley is heavily wooded and the Kunhar river flows through it. A fishing license can be obtained in.Naran that maybe used throughout the valley. Rods, tackle and guides can be hired as well. If you are not up to fishing yourself, you can get a fishing guide to do it for you. He will bring for you the fish he catches by the end of the day. Naran has postal, telephone and medical facilities also, and is a good base for trips to the higher valleys. The Kaghan and Naran valleys are blessed with plenty of water. There is adequate rainfall to feed its forests"

The whole ridge is heavily wooded and there are lovely views from the top. The views are picture perfect, the Kaghan valley stretching into the hazy blue, fold after fold of mountains interwoven by the Kunhar river. There are high pastures above the hotels .At a distance of 500-600 feet one gets to the top of the ridge and to open grassy meadow. There are a few giants of fur trees here at Makra peak, and a stream of sparkling clean water flowing down the mountain. This is a great camp site. The Makra peak is about 2000 feet above this point and an easy day's climb. 116"

The trunks of trees were like thick ropes rolling on the ground with small branches and leaves sprouting all over. They covered the ground so thickly that it was difficult to walk through these patches.

Little do they realize that behind the ridge lies one of the most verdant, lush and charming forests in Pakistan. The forest department has done a wonderful job of protecting the forests of Sharan and those of adjoining valleys. Agood metallic road goes across and up and along the ridge on the other side of the river. Terraced corn fields and flowering bushes lined the road. Farmers had carefully utilized every inch of land that they possessed. Corn fields were protected by stone walls from passing herds of goats or the occasional cow, giving a Mediterranean look to the narrow country track. Huge walnut trees dotted the landscape providing large areas of shade. The road climbed quickly from 5000 feet by the river to the top of the ridge 9000 feet.

Express informed opinions, justify the viewpoint and make recommendations and develop an interest in a variety of texts. , Help them to apply skimming and scanning strategies for relevant information and main points in texts to identify the writer's purpose, and intended audience. Infer the theme/main idea of the . text, distinguishing between fact and opinion where necessary. Encourage them to interpret and integrate information from a variety of sources for comprehension (e.g., maps, graphs, charts, diagrams) Let them acquire and use appropriate words and phrases for reading, writing, speaking, and listening; independently gather vocabulary when considering a word or phrase important for comprehension or expression. Motivate them to demonstrate command of the conventions of Standard English capitalization, punctuation, and spelling when writing in different varieties of texts. Ask"

The impressiveness was habitual and not for show, for spectators were few. The time was barely 10 O'clock at night, but chilly gusts of wind with a taste of rain in them had well deployed the streets. Trying doors as he went, twirling his club with many intricate and artful movements, turning now and then to cast his watchful eye down the pacific thoroughfare, the officer with his stalwart form and slight swagger, made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace. The vicinity was one that kept early hours. Now and then you might see the lights of a cigar store or of an all- night lunch counter; but the majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since been closed. When about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his walk. In the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned, with the unlighted cigar in his mouth. As the policeman walked up to him the man spoke quickly. \u201cit's alright, officer, \u201che said, reassuringly. \u201cI'm just waiting for a friend, It's an appointment made twenty years ago.

They act like bridges, smoothly connecting ideas and guiding your audience through your message. Let's delve into how they create specific effects in both speech and writing: Conjunctions: \u00a2 Coordinating conjunctions (FANBOYS): These workhorses (For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So). They show simple relationships like sequence (\"She woke up, and then made coffee\") or contrast (\"I wanted coffee, but there weren't any beans\u201d). \u00a2 Subordinating conjunctions: These introduce dependent clauses, which rely on an independent clause for complete meaning. They signal a variety of connections between ideas: * Time: \"When the storm hit, the power went out.\u201d (When shows the timing) * Reason: \u201cHe exercised regularly because he wanted to stay healthy.\u201d (Because shows cause and effect) + Condition: \u201cIf you practice, you'll improve.\" (If shows a hypothetical situation) Transitional devices: Transitional devices go beyond basic conjunctions, offering a broader toolkit to show the flow of ideas. They come in various categories: * Sequencing: First, next, then, finally (show order) \u00a2 Cause and effect: Because, therefore, hence (show cause or result) * Contrast: However, conversely, on the other hand (show opposing ideas) \u00a2 Similarity: Likewise, similarly, inthe same way (show connections) \u00a2 Emphasis: In fact, inrueed, moreover (add weight to a point) 135"

They act like signposts, indicating how ideas relate to each other. \u00a2 Relationships: These tools signal the connections between your points. Did you add new information? Contrast an idea? Show a cause and effect? Choosing the right transition helps your audience understand how these ideas fit together. e Emphasis and tone: Transitions can add emphasis or create a specific tone. For example, \"Frankly\" sets a more direct tone than \"In conclusion.\u201d The takeaway: Effective use of conjunctions and transitions takes practice. Here are some tips: e Read actively: Pay attention to how these elements are used in your reading to understand their impact. e\u00a2 Experiment: Try incorporating different transitions into your writing and speech to see how they affect the flow and impact. e Listen closely: Notice how effective speakers use transitional phrases to connect their ideas during presentations or speeches. Activity: Write a short paragraph (5-7 sentences) about a recent experience. Use a variety of conjunctions and transitional devices to create a clear and well-organized message. Be sure to identify the type of conjunction or transitional device you used for each instance (e.g., for contrast - however). b) Use subordinating conjunctions to connect independent clause/s to dependent clause Subordinating Conjunctions Subordinating conjunctions are words that connect two clauses in a sentence, making one clause dependent on the other.

Here are some key features of a descriptive composition: e Sensory details: The writer employs vivid descriptions that appeal to all five senses (sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing). This helps the reader feel like they are actually experiencing what is being described. \u00a2 Figurative language: Techniques like similes, metaphors, and personification are often used to add depth and creativity to the descriptions. * Organization: Descriptive compositions are typically well-organized, with a clear focus and a logical flow of ideas. The writer might use spatial organization (describing something from a specific vantage point), chronological order (describing events in sequence), or another structure to guide the reader's imagination. \u00a2 Emotional impact: The goal is not just to describe something objectively, but to evoke an emotional response in the reader.

    "text": "Notes and Comments William Wordsworth (1770-1850) was born in the lake District of Northern England. Wordsworth was one of the leading figures of English Romanticism, an artistic and intellectual movement that swept across Europe at the end of the 18\" century. The classical poets did not have much Tespect for nature and the common man, but Wordsworth took up new subjects of poetry. His adoration of nature and common simple life were things of Romantic character. His poetry is for common people, reading it, people feel that it is happening to us too, and can relate it to their own lives. The year 1793 saw the first publication of poems by Wordsworth, in the collections An Evening Walk and Descriptive Sketches. Together Wordsworth and Coleridge produced Lyrical Ballads (1798), an important work in the English Romantic Movement. Most famous poems, \u201cTintern Abbey\u201d, published in this collection, along with Coleridge's \u201cThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d. William Wordsworth was the central figure in the English Romantic revolution. His contribution to it was that he formulated in his poems and essays a new attitude towards nature. This was more than a matter of introducing nature imagery into his verse. Secondly, Wordsworth placed poetry at the centre of human experience. In impassioned rhetoric he pronounced poetry to be nothing less than \u201cthe first and last of all knowledge---it is as immortal as the heart of man\u201d. Then he went on to create some of the greatest English poetry of his century. He died of Pleurisy on April 23\", 1850 at the age of 88 in United Kingdom.

Http: //www.britannica.com Themes Themes of the poem The Solitary Reaper\u201d by William Wordsworth revolve around the power of nature, the beauty of simplicity, and the significance of solitary experiences. Isolation and solitude: The poem highlight the solitary existence of the reaper in the field, emphasizing. her separation from society. This solitude can be seen as both a source of tranquility and a cause for loneliness. Connection to Nature: The reaper\u2019s song, which is an unknown language to the speaker, is a direct expression of her connection to nature. The poem suggests that nature has a profound and universal language that transcends cultural and linguistic barriers. Transient Moments of Beauty: Wordsworth captures a fleeting moment of beauty in nature, emphasizing the transient nature of human existence. The beauty of the reaper\u2019s song is compared to that of a nightingale or a cuckoo, evoking a sense of wonder and admiration. The Power of Memory: The speaker reflects on the experience long after it has passed, suggesting the enduring power of memory to evoke emotions and sensations. The memory of the reaper\u2019s song continues to resonate with the speaker, demonstrating the lasting impact of solitary moments in nature. Overall: \u201cThe Solitary Reaper\u201d celebrates the simplicity and beauty of solitary experiences in nature while also exploring themes of isolation, connection, and the passage of time. 143"

    "text": "Grammar and Language The poetic devices used in the poem \u2018The Solitary Reaper\u2019. \u00a2 Hyperbole and Alliteration Hyperbole is an exaggeration for effect, while alliteration is the repetition of initial sounds. Examples of alliteration in the poem The solitary Reaper\u2019 are in the phrases, \u2018No Nightingale\u2019, \u2018Among Arabian\u2019. \u2018Silence of the Seas\u2019.In each of these phrases, the initial sound is repeated, which is the technique of alliteration. According to the poet, solitary reaper's song can be heard \u2018breaking the silence of the seas, Among the farthest Hebrides. The Hebrides are an island along the northern coast of Scotland, which means that her voice was travelling for miles and miles, which is exaggeration of hyperbole. \u00a2 Metaphor The poet uses metaphors to compare the reaper's song to the nightingale\u2019s and cuckoo's song, highlighting the beauty and impact of her singing. \u00a2 Enjambment The poet uses enjambment to create a flowing, continuous feel to the poem, much like the unbroken song of the reaper. \u00a2 Imagery Imagery used ina literary work enables the readers to perceive things involving their five senses. Example: \u2018Reaping and singing by herself\u2019, \u2018| saw her singing at her work\u2019, and \u2018More welcome notes to weary bands\u2019, gives a pictorial description of the young woman at work. a) Questions related to the poem 1.

Sometimes other methods of communication (face-to-face, phone, instant messaging, video conferencing, etc.) may be more appropriate. Types of email in the workplace There are two primary types of email in the workplace: Request-and-Reply Emails: Most emails in the workplace fall into this category. Request emails usually expect a reply. This kind of email could ask questions, specify tasks people need to complete, or ask colleagues to acknowledge or comment on policies, meetings, or projects. Confirmation Emails: This kind of email creates a permanent, written record of a conversation that has taken place. For example, if you and a colleague discussed collaborating on a project over lunch, you might send them an email with the details of that conversation. This gives you both a record of the conversation and allows for the conversation to continue, if needed. Essential email components Subjectline The subject line of your email should offer your reader the purpose of the email, but it should also be brief. If your subject line is vague, people may ignore your email, or it may be sent to the junk/spam folder. 2 Vague: Budget Specific: Budget Revision Request Greeting Choosing a greeting may appear to be an easy task, but you have to select the appropriate level of formality. Emailing a coworker with whom you are friends to ask a brief question is different from emailing your supervisor with a work-related request.

They tell of Kino, the fisherman, and of his wife, Juana, and of the baby, Coyotito. And because the story has been told so often, it has taken root in every man's mind. And, as with all retold tales that are in people's hearts, there are only good and bad things and black and white things and good and evil things and no in-between anywhere. \u201cIf this story is a parable, perhaps everyone takes his own meaning from it and reads his own life into it.

The roosters had been crowing for some time, and the early animals were already beginning their ceaseless turning of twigs and bits of wood to see whether anything to eat had been overlooked. Outside the brush house in the tuna clump, a covey of little birds chittered and flurried with their wings. Kino\u2019s eyes opened, and he looked first at the lightening square which was the door and then he looked at the hanging box where Coyotito slept. And last he turned his head to Juana, his wife, who lay on the mat, her blue head shawl over her nose and around the small of her back. Juana\u2019s eyes were open too.

Kino heard the little splash of morning waves on the beach. It was very good- Kino closed his eyes again to listen to his music. Perhaps he alone did this and perhaps all of his people did it. His people had once been great makers of songs so that everything they saw or thought or did or heard became a song. That was very long ago. The songs remained; Kino knew them, but no new songs were added. That does not mean that there were no personal songs. In Kino's head there was a song now, clear and soft, and if he had been able to speak of it, he would have called it the Song of the Family. His blanket was over his nose to protect him from the dank air. His eyes flicked to a rustle beside him. It was Juana arising, almost soundlessly. On her hard bare feet she went to the hanging box where Coyotito slept, and she leaned over and said a Little reassuring word. Coyotito looked up for a moment and closed his eyes and slept again.

A late moth blustered in to find the fire. The Song of the Family came now from behind Kino. And the rhythm of the family song was the grinding stone where Juana worked the corn for the morning cakes. The dawn came quickly now, a wash, a glow, a lightness, and then an explosion of fire as the sun arose out of the Gulf. Kino looked down to cover his eyes from the glare. He could hear the pat of the corncakes in the house and the rich smell of them on the cooking plate. The ants were busy on the ground, big black ones with shiny bodies, and little dusty quick ants. Kino watched with the detachment of God while a dusty ant frantically tried to escape the sand trap an ant lion had dug for him. A thin, timid dog came close and, at a soft word from Kino, curled up, arranged its tail neatly over its feet, and laid its chin delicately on the pile. It was a black dog with yellow-gold spots where its eyebrows should have been. It was a morning like other mornings and yet perfect among mornings. Kino heard the creak of the rope when Juana took Coyotito out of his hanging box and cleaned him. Kino could see these things without looking at them. Juana sang softly an ancient song that had only three notes and yet endless variety of interval. And this was part of the family song too. It was all part.

Across the brush fence were other brush houses, and the smoke came from them too, and the sound of breakfast. Kino was young and strong and his black hair hung over his brown forehead. His eyes were warm and fierce and bright and his mustache was thin and coarse. He lowered his blanket from his nose now, for the dark poisonous air was gone and the yellow sunlight fell on the house. Near the brush fence two roosters bowed and feinted at each other with squared wings and neck feathers ruffed out. It would be a clumsy fight. They were not game chickens. Kino watched them for a moment, and then his eyes went up to a flight of wild doves twinkling inland to the hills. The world was awake now, and Kino arose and went into his brush house. As he came through the door Juana stood up from the glowing fire pit. She put Coyotito back in his hanging box and then she combed her black hair and braided it in two braids and tied the ends with thin green ribbon. Kino squatted by the fire pit and rolled a hot corncake and dipped it in sauce and ate it. And he drank a little tea and that was breakfast.

When Kino had finished, Juana came back to the fire and ate her breakfast. They had spoken once, but there is no need for speech if it is only a habit anyway. Kino sighed with satisfaction- and that was conversation. The sun was warmirtg the brush house, breaking through its crevices in long streaks. And one of the streaks fell on the hanging box where Coyotito lay, and on the ropes that held it. It was a tiny movement that drew their eyes to the hanging box. Kino and Juana froze in their positions. Down the rope that hung the baby\u2019s box from the roof support a scorpion moved slowly. His stinging tail was straight out behind him, but he could whip it up in a flash of time. Kino\u2019s breath whistled in his nostrils and he opened his mouth to stop it. And then the startled look was gone from him and the rigidity from his body. |n his mind a new song had come, the Song of Evil, the music of the enemy, of any foe of the family, a savage, secret, dangerous melody, and underneath, the Song of the Family cried plaintively. The scorpion moved delicately down the rope toward the box.

It stopped, and its tail rose up over its back in little jerks and the curved thorn on the tail\u2019s end glistened. Kino stood perfectly still. He could hear Juana whispering the old magic again, and he could hear the evil music of the enemy. He could not move until the scorpion moved, and it felt for the source of the death that was coming to it. Kino's hand went forward very slowly, very smoothly. The thorned tail jerked upright. And at that moment the laughing Coyotito shook the rope and the scorpion fell. Kino's Di leaped to catch it, but it fell past his fingers, fell on the baby\u2019s shoulder, landed and struck. Then, snarling, Kino had it, had it in his fingers, rubbing it to a paste in his hands. He threw it down and beat it into the earth floor with his fist, and Coyotito screamed with pain in his box. But Kino beat and stamped the enemy until it was only a fragment and a moist place in the dirt. His teeth were bared and fury flared in his eyes and the Song of the Enemy roared in his ears.

She put her lips down over the puncture and sucked hard and spat and sucked again while Coyotito screamed. Kino hovered; he was helpless, he was in the way. The screams of the baby brought the neighbors. Out of their brush houses they poured- Kino's brother Juan Tomas and his fat wife Apolonia and their four children crowded in the door and blocked the entrance, while behind them others tried to look in, and one small boy crawled among legs to have a look. And those in front passed the word back to those behind- \u201cScorpion. The baby has been stung.\u201d Juana stopped sucking the puncture for a moment. The little hole was slightly enlarged and its edges whitened from the sucking, but the red swelling extended farther around it in a hard lymphatic mound. And all of these people knew about the scorpion. An adult might be very ill from the sting, but a baby could easily die from the poison. First, they knew, would come swelling and fever and tightened throat, and then cramps in the stomach, and then Coyotito might die if enough of the poison had gone in. But the stinging pain of the bite was going away. Coyotito's screams turned to moans. Kino had wondered often at the iron in his patient, fragile wife. She, who was obedient and respectful and cheerful and patient, she could arch her back in child pain with hardly a cry. She could stand fatigue and hunger almost better than Kino himself. In the canoe she was like a strong man. And now she did a most surprising thing. \u201cThe doctor,\u201d she said. \"Go to get the doctor.\u201d The word was passed"

The people in the door pushed against those behind to let her through. Kino followed her. They went out of the gate to the rutted path and the neighbors followed them. The thing had become a neighborhood affair. They made a quick soft-footed procession into the center of the town, first Juana and Kino, and behind them Juan Tomas and Apolonia, then all the neighbors with the children trotting on the flanks. And the yellow sun threw their black shadows ahead of them so that they walked on their own shadows. They came to the place where the brush houses stopped and the city of stone and plaster began, the city of harsh outer walls and inner cool gardens where a little water played and the bougainvillea crusted the walls with purple and brick-red and white.

The four beggars in front of the church knew everything in the town. They were students of the expressions of young women as they went in to confession, and they saw them as they came out and read the nature of the sin. They knew every little scandal and some very big crimes. They slept at their posts in the shadow of the church so that no one crept in for consolation without their knowledge. And they knew the doctor. They knew his ignorance, his cruelty, his avarice, his sins. They knew his clumsy attitudeThey had seen his corpses go into the church.

And on the beach the white and blue canoes that came from Nayarit were drawn up, canoes preserved for generations by a hard shell-like waterproof plaster whose making was a secret of the fishing people. They were high and graceful canoes with curving bow and stern and a braced section midships where a mast could be stepped to carry a small lateen sail. The beach was yellow sand, but at the water's edge a rubble of shell and algae took its place. Fiddler crabs bubbled and sputtered in their holes in the sand, and in the shallows little lobsters popped in and out of their tiny homes in the rubble and sand. The sea bottom was rich with crawling and swimming and growing things. The brown algae waved in the gentle currents and the green eel grass swayed and little sea horses clung to its stems. Spotted botete, the poison fish, lay on the bottom in the eel-grass beds, and the bright-colored swimming crabs scampered over them. On the beach the hungry dogs and the hungry pigs of the town searched endlessly for any dead fish or sea bird that might have floated in on arising tide. Although the morning was"

On the beach the hungry dogs and the hungry pigs of the town searched endlessly for any dead fish or sea bird that might have floated in on arising tide. Although the morning was young, the hazy mirage was up. The uncertain air that magnified some things and blotted out others hung over the whole Gulf so that all sights were unreal and vision could not be trusted; so that sea and land had the sharp clarities and the vagueness of a dream. Thus it might be that the people of the Gulf trust things of the spirit and things of the imagination, but they do not trust their eyes to show them distance or clear outline or any optical exactness. Across the estuary from the town one section of mangroves stood clear and telescopically defined, while another mangrove clump was a hazy black-green blob. Part of the far shore disappeared into a shimmer that looked like water. There was no certainty in seeing, no proof that what you saw was there or was not there. And the people of the Gulf expected all places were that way, and it was not strange to them. Acopper haze hung over the water ,and the hot morning sun beat on it and made it vibrate blindingly. The brush houses of the fishing people were back from the beach on the right-hand side of the town, and the canoes were drawn up in front of this area. Kino and Juana came slowly down to the beach and to Kino's canoe, which was the one thing of value he owned in the world. It was very old.

It was at once property and source of food, for a man with a boat can guarantee a woman that she will eat something. It is the bulwark against starvation. And every year Kino refinished his canoe with the hard shell-like plaster by the secret method that had also come to him from his father. Now he came to the canoe and touched the bow tenderly as he always did. He laid his diving rock and his basket and the two ropes in the sand by the canoe.

He was quiet now, but the swelling on his shoulder had continued up his neck and under his ear and his face was puffed and feverish. Juana went to the water and waded in. She gathered some brown seaweed and made a flat damp poultice of it, and this she applied to the baby's swollen shoulder, which was as good a remedy as any and probably better than the doctor could have done. But the remedy lacked his authority because it was simple and didn't cost anything. The stomach cramps had not come to Coyotito. Perhaps Juana had sucked out the poison in time, but she had not sucked out her worry over her first-born. She had not prayed directly for the recovery of the baby- she had prayed that they might find a pearl with which to hire the doctor to cure the baby, for the minds of people are as unsubstantial as the mirage of the Gulf. Now Kino and Juana slid the canoe down the beach to the water, and when the bow floated, Juana climbed in, while Kino pushed the stern in and waded beside it until it floated lightly and trembled on the little breaking waves. Then in coordination Juana and Kino drove their double-bladed paddles into the sea, and the canoe creased the water and hissed with speed. The other pearlers were gone out long since. In a few moments Kino could see them clustered in the haze, riding over the oyster bed.

Light filtered down through the water to the bed where the frilly pearl oysters lay fastened to the rubbly bottom, a bottom strewn with shells of broken, opened oysters. This was the bed that had raised the King of Spain to be a great power in Europe in past years, had helped to pay for his wars, and had decorated the churches for his soul's sake. The gray oysters with ruffles like skirts on the shells, the barnacle-crusted oysters with little bits of weed clinging to the skirts and small crabs climbing over them. An accident could happen to these oysters, a grain of sand could lie in the folds of muscle and irritate the flesh until in self-protection the flesh coated the grain with a layer of smooth cement. But once started, the flesh continued to coat the foreign body until it fell free in some tidal flurry or until the oyster was destroyed. For centuries men had dived down and torn the oysters from the beds and ripped them open, looking for the coated grains of sand. Swarms of fish lived near the bed to live near the oysters thrown back by the searching men and to nibble at the shining inner shells. But the pearls were accidents, and the finding of one was luck, a little pat on the back by God or the gods or both. Kino had two ropes, one tied to a heavy stone and one to a basket.

The bubbles rose behind him until the water cleared and he could see. Above, the surface of the water was an undulating mirror of brightness, and he could see the bottoms of the canoes sticking through it. Kino moved cautiously so that the water would not be obscured with mud or sand. He hooked his foot in the loop on his rock and his hands worked quickly, tearing the oysters loose, some singly, others in clusters. He laid them in his basket. In some places the oysters clung to one another so that they came free in lumps. Now, Kino'\u2019s people had sung of everything that happened or existed. They had made songs to the fishes, to the sea in anger and to the sea in calm, to the light and the dark and the sun and the moon, and the songs were all in Kino and in his people- every song that had ever been made, even the ones forgotten.

But in the song there was a secret little inner song, hardly perceptible, but always there, sweet and secret and clinging, almost hiding in the counter- melody, and this was the Song of the Pearl That Might Be, for every shell thrown in the basket might contain a pearl. Chance was against it, but luck and the gods might be for it. And in the canoe above him Kino knew that Juana was making the magic of prayer, her face set rigid and her muscles hard to force the luck, to tear the luck out of the gods\u2019 hands, for she needed the luck for the swollen shoulder of Coyotito. And because the need was great and the desire was great, the little secret melody of the pearl that might be was stronger this morning. Whole phrases of it came clearly and softly into the Song of the Undersea. Kino, in his pride and youth and strength, could remain down over two minutes without strain, so that he worked deliberately, selecting the largest shells. Because they were disturbed, the oyster shells were tightly closed. A little to his right a hummock of rubbly rock stuck up, covered with young oysters not ready to take. Kino moved next to the hummock, and then, beside it, under a little overhang, he saw a very large oyster lying by itself, not covered with its clinging brothers. The shell was partly open, for the overhang protected this ancient oyster, and in the lip-like muscle Kino saw a ghostly gleam, and"

He kicked his foot free from the rock loop, and his body rose to the surface and his black hair gleamed in the sunlight. He reached over the side of the canoe and laid the oyster in the bottom. Then Juana steadied the boat while he climbed in. His eyes were shining with excitement, but in decency he pulled up his rock, and then he pulled up his basket of oysters and lifted them in. Juana sensed his excitement, and she pretended to look away, It is not good to want a thing too much. It sometimes drives the luck away. You must want it just enough, and you must be very tactful with God. But Juana stopped breathing. Very deliberately Kino opened his short strong knife. He looked speculatively at the basket. Perhaps it would be better to open the oyster last. He took a small oyster from the basket, cut the muscle, searched the folds of flesh, and threw it in the water. Then he seemed to see the great oyster for the first time. He squatted in the bottom of the canoe, picked up the shell and examined it.

But Juana\u2019s eyes were on him and she could not wait. She put her hand on Coyotito\u2019s covered head. \"Open it,\u201d she said softly. Kino deftly slipped his knife into the edge of the shell. Through the knife he could feel the muscle tighten hard. He worked the blade lever-wise and the closing muscle parted and the shell fell apart. The lip-like flesh writhed up and then subsided. Kino lifted the flesh, and there it lay, the great pearl, perfect as the moon. It captured the light and refined it and gave it back in silver incandescence. It was as large as a sea-gull's egg. It was the greatest pearl in the world. Juana caught her breath and moaned a little. And to Kino the secret melody of the maybe pearl broke clear and beautiful, rich and warm and lovely, glowing and gloating and triumphant. In the surface of the great pearl he could see dream forms.

A town has a nervous system and a head and shoulders and feet. A town is a thing separate from all other towns, so that there are no two towns alike. Anda town has a whole emotion. How news travels through a town is a mystery not easily to be solved. News seems to move faster than small boys can scramble and dart to tell it, faster than women can call it over the fences. Before Kino and Juana and the other fishers had come to Kino's brush house, the nerves of the town were pulsing and vibrating with the news-Kino had found the Peart of the World.

And he wondered whether he had baptized Kino's baby, or married him for that matter. The news came to the shopkeepers, and they looked at men's clothes that had not sold so well.

The news stirred up something infinitely black and evil in the town; the black distillate was like the scorpion, or like hunger in the smell of food, or like loneliness when love is withheld. The poison sacs of the town began to manufacture venom, and the town swelled and puffed with the pressure of it. But Kino and Juana did not know these things.

But the priest was speaking again. \"It has come to me that thou hast found a great fortune, a great pearl.\u201d Kino opened his hand and held it out, and the priest gasped a little at the size and beauty of the pearl. And then he said, \"I hope thou wilt remember to give thanks, my son, to Him who has given thee this treasure, and to pray for guidance in the future.\u201d Kino nodded dumbly, and it was Juana who spoke softly. \"We will, Father. And we will be ; married now. Kino has said so.\" She looked at the neighbors for confirmation, and they nodded their heads solemnly. Th\u00e9 priest said, \u201cIt is pleasant to see that your first thoughts are good thoughts. God bless you, my children.\u201d He turned and left quietly, and the people let him through. But Kino\u2019s hand had closed tightly on the pearl again, and he was glancing about suspiciously, for the evil song was in his ears, shrilling against the music of the pearl. The neighbors"

The neighbors slipped away to go to their houses, and Juana squatted by the fire and set her clay pot of boiled beans over the little flame. Kino stepped to the doorway and looked out. As always, he could smell the smoke from many fires, and he could see the hazy stars and feel the damp of the night air so that he covered his nose from it. The thin dog came to him and threshed itself in greeting like a windblown flag, and Kino looked down at it and didn't see it. He had broken through the horizons into a cold and lonely outside. He felt alone and unprotected, and scraping crickets and shrilling tree frogs and croaking toads seemed to be carrying the melody of evil. Kino shivered a little and drew his blanket more tightly against his nose. He carried the pearl still in his hand, tightly closed in his palm, and it was warm and smooth against his skin. Behind him he heard Juana patting the cakes before she put them down on the clay cooking sheet. Kino felt all the warmth and security of his family behind him, and the Song of the Family came from behind him like the purring of a kitten.

And this Kino knew also- that the gods do not love men\u2019s plans, and the gods do not love success unless it comes by accident. He knew that the gods take their revenge on a man if he be successful through his own efforts. Consequently Kino was afraid of plans, but having made one, he could never destroy it.

And when the doctor went to her and held out his hand, she clutched the baby tight and looked at Kino where he stood with the fire shadows leaping on his face. Kino nodded, and only then did she let the doctor take the baby. \"Hold the light,\u201d the doctor said, and when the servant held the lantern high, the doctor looked for amoment at the wound on the baby\u2019s shoulder.

And the beauty of the pearl, winking and glimmering in the light of the little candle, cozened his brain with its beauty. So lovely it was, so soft, and its own music came from it- its music of promise and delight, its guarantee of the future, of comfort, of security. Its warm lucence promised a poultice against illness and a wall against insult. It closed a door on hunger. And as he stared at it Kino\u2019s eyes softened and his face relaxed. He could see the little image of the consecrated candle reflected in the soft surface of the pearl, and he heard again in his ears the lovely music of the undersea, the tone of the diffused green light of the sea bottom.

The little boys knew about it with excitement, but most of all the pearl buyers knew about it, and when the day had come, in the offices of the pearl buyers, each man sat alone with his little black velvet tray, and each man rolled the pearls about with his fingertips and considered his part in the picture. It was supposed that the pearl buyers were individuals acting alone, bidding against one another for the pearls the fishermen brought in. And once it had been so. But this was a wasteful method, for often, in the excitement of bidding for a fine pearl, too great a price had been paid to the fishermen. This was extravagant and not to be countenanced. Now there was only one pearl buyer with many hands, and the men who sat in their offices and waited for Kino knew what price they would offer, how high they would bid, and what method each one would use. And although these men would not profit beyond their salaries, there was excitement among the pearl buyers, for there was excitement in the hunt, and if it be a man's function to break down a price, then he must take joy and satisfaction in breaking it as far down as possible. For every man in the world functions to the best of his ability, and no one does less than his best, no matter what he may think about it.

The sun was hot yellow that morning, and it drew the moisture from the estuary and from the Gulf and hung it in shimmering scarves in the air so that the air vibrated and vision was insubstantial. A vision hung in the air to the north of the city- the vision of a mountain that was over two hundred miles away, and the high slopes of this mountain were swaddled with pines and a great stone peak arose above the timber line. And the morning of this day the canoes lay lined up.on the beach; the fishermen did not go out to dive for pearls, for there would be too much happening, too many things to see, when Kino went to sell the great pearl. In the brush houses by the shore Kino\u2019s neighbors sat long over their breakfasts, and they spoke of what they would do if they had found the pearl. And one man said that he would give it as a present to the Holy Father in Rome. Another said that he would buy Masses for the souls of his family for a thousand years. Another thought he might take the money and distribute it among the poor of La Paz; and a fourth thought of all the good things one could do with the money from the pearl, of all the charities, benefits, of all the rescues one could perform if one had money.

There was no self-consciousness about their joining Kino and Juana to go pearl selling. It was expected, it was an historic moment, they would be crazy if they didn't go. It would be almost a sign of unfriendship. Juana put on her head shawl carefully, and she draped one long end under her right elbow and gathered it with her right hand so that a hammock hung under her arm, and in this little hammock she placed Coyotito, propped up against the head shawl so that he could see everything and perhaps remember. Kino put on his large straw hat and felt it with his hand to see that it was properly placed, not on the back or side of his head, like a rash, unmarried, irresponsible man, and not flat as an elder would wear it, but tilted a little forward to show aggressiveness and seriousness and vigor. There is a great deal to be seen in the tilt of ahat ona man. Kino slipped his feet into his sandals and pulled the thongs up over his heels. The great pearl was wrapped in an old soft piece of deerskin and placed in a little leather bag, and the leather bag was in a pocket in Kino's shirt. He folded his blanket carefully and draped it in a narrow strip over his left shoulder, and now they were ready. Kino stepped with dignity out of the house, and Juana followed him, carrying Coyotito.

And in the four hundred years Kino's people had learned only one defense- a slight slitting of the eyes and a slight tightening of the lips and a retirement. Nothing could break down this wall, and they could remain whole within the wall. The gathering procession was solemn, for they sensed the importance of this day, and any children who showed a tendency to scuffle, to scream, to cry out, to steal hats and rumple hair, were hissed to silence by their elders. So important was this day that an old man came to see, riding on the stalwart shoulders of his nephew. The procession left the brush huts and entered the stone and plaster city where the streets were a little wider and there were narrow pavements beside the building. And as before, the beggars joined them as they passed the church; the grocers looked out at them as they went by; the little saloons lost their customers and the owners closed up shop and went along. And the sun beat down on the streets of the city and even tiny stones threw shadows on the ground.

This morning he had placed a flower in a vase on his desk, a single scarlet hibiscus, and the vase sat beside the black velvet-lined pearl tray in front of him. He was shaved close to the blue roots of his beard, and his hands were clean and his nails polished. His door stood open to the morning, and he hummed under his breath while his right hand practiced legerdemain.

Well, let us see your pearl. We will value it and give you the best price.\u201d And his fingers worked furiously with the coin. Now Kino instinctively knew his own dramatic effects. Slowly he brought out the leather bag, slowly took from it the soft and dirty piece of deerskin, and then he let the great pearl roll into the black velvet tray, and instantly his eyes went to the buyer's face. But there was no sign, no movement, the face did not change, but the secret hand behind the desk missed in its precision. The coin stumbled over a knuckle and slipped silently into the dealer's lap. And the fingers behind the desk curled into a fist. When the right hand came out of hiding, the forefinger touched the great pearl, rolled it on the black velvet; thumb and forefinger picked it up and brought it near to the dealer's eyes and twirled it in the air. Kino held his breath, and the neighbors held their breath, and the whispering went back through the crowd. \u201cHe is inspecting it- No price has been mentioned yet- They have not come toa price.\u201d Now the dealer's hand had become a personality.

He arose, saying, \u201cGo with God,\" And Kino said, \u201cGo with God,\u201d and did not even look up, for the words had a strange chillin them. Long after Juan Tomas had gone Kino sat brooding on his sleeping mat. A lethargy had settled on him, and a little gray hopelessness. Every road seemed blocked against him. In his head he heard only the dark music of the enemy. His senses were burningly alive, but his mind went back to the deep participation with all things, the gift he had from his people. He heard every little sound of the gathering night, the sleepy complaint of settling birds, the love agony of cats, the strike and withdrawal of little waves on the beach, and the simple hiss of distance. And he could smell the sharp odor of exposed kelp from the receding tide. The little flare of the twig fire made the design on his steeping mat jump before his entranced eyes. Juana watched him with worry, but she knew him and she knew she could help him best by being silent and by being near. And as though she too could hear the Song of Evil, she fought it, singing softly the melody of the family, of the safety and warmth and wholeness of the family. She held Coyotito in her arms and sang the song to him, to keep the evil out, and her voice was brave against the threat of the dark music. Kino did not move nor ask for his supper. She knew he would ask when he wanted it. His eyes were entranced, and he could sense the wary, watchful evil outside the brush house; he could feel the dark"

His eyes were entranced, and he could sense the wary, watchful evil outside the brush house; he could feel the dark creeping things waiting for him to go out into the night. It was shadowy and dreadful, and yet it called to him and threatened him and challenged him. His right hand went into his shirt and felt his knife; his eyes were wide; he stood up and walked to the doorway. Juana willed to stop him; she raised her hand to stop him, and her mouth opened with terror. Fora long moment Kino looked out into the darkness and then he stepped outside, Juana heard the little rush, the grunting struggle, the blow. She froze with terror for a moment, and then her lips drew back from her teeth like a cat's lips. She set Coyotito down on the ground. She seized a stone from the fireplace and rushed outside, but it was over by then. Kino lay on the ground, struggling to rise, and there was no one near him. Only the shadows and the strike and rush of waves and the hiss of distance. But the evil was all about, hidden behind the brush fence, crouched beside the house in the shadow, hovering in the air. Juana dropped her stone, and she put her arms around Kino and helped him to his feet and supported him into the house. Blood oozed down from his scalp and there was a long deep cut in his cheek from ear to chin, a deep, bleeding slash. And Kino was only half conscious. He shook his head from side to side. His"

He rolled up to his feet and followed her as silently as she had gone, and he could hear her quick footsteps going toward the shore. Quietly he tracked her, and his brain was red with anger. She burst clear out of the brush line and stumbled over the little boulders toward the water, and then she heard him coming and she broke into a run. Her arm was up to throw when he leaped at her and caught her arm and wrenched the pearl from her. He struck her in the face with his clenched fist and she fell among the boulders, and he kicked her in the side. In the pale light he could see the little waves break over her, and her skirt floated about and clung to her legs as the water receded. Kino looked down at her an@his teeth were bared.

Juana dragged herself up from the rocks on the edge of the water. Her face was a dull pain and her side ached. She steadied herself on her knees for a while and her wet skirt clung to her. There was no anger in her for Kino. He had said, \u201cl am a man,\u201d and that meant certain things to Juana. It meant that he was half insane and half god. It meant that Kino would drive his strength against a mountain and plunge his strength against the sea. Juana, in her woman's soul, knew that the mountain would stand while the man broke himself; that the sea would surge while the man drowned in it. And yet it was this thing that made him a man, half insane and half god, and Juana had need of aman; she could not live without a man. Although she might be puzzled by these differences between man and woman, she knew them and accepted them and needed them. Of course she would follow him, there was no question of that. Sometimes the quality of woman, the reason, the caution, the sense of preservation, could cut through Kino\u2019s manness and save them all. She climbed painfully to her feet, and she dipped her cupped palms in the little waves and washed her bruised face with the stinging salt water, and then she went creeping up the beach after Kino.

She leaped forward and saw that one was Kino and the other a stranger with dark shiny fluid leaking from his throat. Kino moved sluggishly, arms and legs stirred like those of a crushed bug, and a thick muttering came from his mouth. Now, in an instant, Juana knew that the old life was gone forever. A dead man in the path and Kino\u2019s knife, dark-bladed beside him, convinced her. All of the time Juana had been trying to rescue something of the old peace, of the time before the pearl.

And a searing rage came to him and gave him strength. Now the darkness was closing in on his family; now the evil music filled the night, hung over the mangroves, skirled in the wave beat. The canoe of his grandfather, plastered over and over, and a splintered hole broken in it. This was an evil beyond thinking. The killing of a man was not so evil as the killing of a boat. For a boat does not have sons, and a boat cannot protect itself, and a wounded boat does not heal. There was sorrow in Kino's rage, but this last thing had tightened him beyond breaking. He was an animal now, for hiding, for attacking, and he lived only to preserve himself and his family. He was not conscious of the pain in his head. He leaped up the beach, through the brush line toward his brush house, and it did not occur to him to take one of the canoes of his neighbors. Never once did the thought enter his head, any more than he could have conceived breaking a boat. The roosters were crowing and the dawn was not far off.

Now he was not confused, for there was only one thing to do, and Kino\u2019s hand went first to the great pearl in his shirt and then to his knife hanging under his shirt. He saw a little glow ahead of him, and then without interval a tall flame leaped up in the dark with a crackling roar, and a tall edifice of fire lighted the pathway. Kino broke into a run; it was his brush house, he knew. And he knew that these houses could burn down in a very few moments. And as he ran a scuttling figure ran toward him- Juana, with Coyotito in her arms and Kino's shoulder blanket clutched in her hand.

They saw the flames tall and furious, they saw the roof fall and watched the fire die down as quickly as a twig fire dies. They heard the cries of warning of their friends, and the shrill, keening cry of Apolonia, wife of Juan Tomas. She, being the nearest woman relative, raised a formal lament for the dead of the family. Apolonia realized that she was wearing her second-best head shawl and she rushed to her house to get her fine new one. As she rummaged in a box by the wall, Kino's voice said quietly, \u201cApolonia, do not cry out.

The two walked carefully, and they avaided the center of the town where some sleeper in a doorway might see them pass. For the town closed itself in against the night, and anyone who moved about in the darkness would be noticeable. Kino threaded his way around the edge of the city and turned north, north by the stars, and found the rutted sandy road that led through the brushy country toward Loreto where the miraculous Virgin has her station. Kino could feel the blown sand against his ankles and he was glad, for he knew there would be no tracks. The little light from the stars made out for him the narrow road through the brushy 178"

Through his fear of dark and the devils that haunt the night, there came a rush of exhilaration; some animal thing was moving in him so that he was cautious and wary and dangerous; some ancient thing out of the past of his people was alive in him. The wind was at his back and the stars guided him. The wind cried and whisked in the brush, and the family went on monotonously, hour after hour. They passed no one and saw no one. At last, to their right, the waning moon arose, and when it came up the wind died down, and the land was still. \u00e9 ; Now they could see the little road ahead of them, deep cut with sand-drifted wheel tracks. With the wind gone there would be footprints, but they were a good distance from the town and perhaps their tracks might not be noticed. Kino walked carefully in a wheel rut, and Juana followed in his path. One big cart, going to the town in the morning, could wipe out every trace of their passage. All night they walked and never changed their pace. Once Coyotito awakened, and Juana shifted him in front of her and soothed him until he went to sleep again.

All night they walked, and in the first dawn Kino searched the roadside for a covert to lie in during the day. He found his place near to the road, a little clearing where deer might have lain, and it was curtained thickly with the dry brittle trees that lined the road. And when Juana had seated herself and had settled to nurse the baby, Kino went back to the road. He broke a branch and carefully swept the footprints where they had turned from the roadway. And then, in the first light, he heard the creak of a wagon, and he crouched beside the road and watched a heavy two-wheeled cart go by, drawn by slouching oxen. And when it had passed out of sight, he went back to the roadway and looked at the rut and found that the footprints were gone. And again he swept out his traces and went back to Juana. She gave him the soft corncakes Apolonia had packed for them, and after a while she slept a little. But Kino sat on the ground and stared at the earth in front of him.

They were not near the Gulf now, and the air was dry and hot so that the brush cricked with heat and a good resinous smell came from it. And when Juana awakened, when the sun was high, Kino told her things she knew already. \u201cBeware of that kind of tree there,\" he said, pointing. \u201cDo not touch it, for if you do and then touch your eyes, it will blind you. And beware of the tree that bleeds, See, that one over there.

Here, he and Juana might have stepped out of the wheel rut, and these people from the inland, these hunters, could follow, could read a broken straw or a little tumbled pile of dust. Behind them, on a horse, was a dark man, his nose covered with a blanket, and across his saddle a rifle gleamed in the sun. Kino lay as rigid as the tree limb. He barely breathed, and his eyes went to the place where he had swept out the track. Even the sweeping might be a message to the trackers. He knew these inland hunters. In a country where there was little game they managed to live because of their ability to hunt, and they were hunting him. They scuttled over the ground like animals and found a sign and crouched over it while the horseman waited. The trackers whined a little, like excited dogs on a warming trail. Kino slowly drew his big knife to his hand and made it ready. He knew what he must do. If the trackers found the swept place, he must leap for the horseman, kill him quickly and take the rifle. That was his only chance in the world. And as the three drew nearer on the road, Kino dug little pits with his sandaled toes so that he could leap without warning, so that his feet would not slip. He had only a little vision under the fallen limb. Now Juana, back in her hidden place, heard the pad of the horse's hoofs, and Coyotito gurgled.

He saw the dark horny feet of the men and their ragged white clothes, and he heard the creak of leather of the saddle and the clink of spurs. The trackers stopped at the swept place and studied it, and the horseman stopped. The horse flung his head up against the bit and the bit-roller clicked under his tongue and the horse snorted. Then the dark trackers turned and studied the horse and watched his ears. Kino was not breathing, but his back arched a little and the muscles of his arms and legs stood out with tension and a line of sweat formed on his upper lip. For a long moment the trackers bent over the road, and then they moved on slowly, studying the ground ahead of them, and the horseman moved after them. The trackers scuttled along, stopping, looking, and hurrying on. They would be back, Kino knew. They would be circling and searching, peeping, stopping, and they would come back sooner or later to his covered track. He slid backward and did not bother to cover his tracks. He could not; too many little signs were there, too many broken twigs and scuffed places and displaced stones. And there was a panic in Kino now, a panic of flight.

Maybe we can lose them in the mountains.\u201d Frantically he gathered the gourds and the little bags that were their property. Kino carried a bundle in his left hand, but the big knife swung free in his right hand. He parted the brush for Juana and they hurried to the west, toward the high stone mountains. They trotted quickly through the tangle of the undergrowth. This was panic flight. Kino did not try to conceal his passage he trotted, kicking the stones, knocking the telltale leaves from the little trees. The high sun streamed down on the dry creaking earth so that even the vegetation ticked in protest. But ahead were the naked granite mountains, rising out of erosion rubble and standing monolithic against the sky. And Kino ran for the high place, as nearly all animals do when they are pursued. This land was waterless, furred with the cacti which could store water and with the great-rooted brush which could reachdeep into the earth for a little moisture and get along on very little. And underfoot was not soil but broken rock, split into small cubes, great slabs, but none of it water- rounded. Little tufts of sad dry grass grew between the stones, grass that had sprouted with one single rain and headed, dropped its seed, and died.

The singing heat lay over this desert country, and ahead the stone mountains looked cool and welcoming. And Kino fled. He knew what would happen. Alittle way along the road the trackers would become aware that they had missed the path, and they would come back, searching and judging, and ina little while they would find the place where Kino and Juana had rested. From there it would be easy for them- these little stones, the fallen leaves and the whipped branches, the scuffed places where a foot had slipped. Kino could see them in his mind, slipping along the track, whining a little with eagerness, and behind them, dark and half disinterested, the horseman with the rifle. His work would come last, for he would not take them back. Oh, the music of evil sang loud in Kino's head now, it sang with the whine of heat and with the dry ringing of snake rattles. It was not large and overwhelming now, but secret and poisonous, and the pounding of his heart gave it undertone and rhythm. The way began to rise, and as it did the rocks grew larger. But now Kino had put a little distance between his family and the trackers. Now, on the first rise, he rested.

Then she handed the bottle to him, but he shook his head. Her eyes were bright in her tired face.

He shrugged his shoulders helplessly then, but he had taken strength from her. When they moved on it was no longer panic flight. The country, as it rose toward the mountains, changed rapidly. Now there were long outcroppings of granite with deep crevices between, and Kino walked on bare unmarkable stone when he could and leaped from ledge to ledge. He knew that wherever the trackers lost his path they must circle and lose time before they found it again. And so he did not go straight for the mountains anymore; he moved in zigzags, and sometimes he cut back to the south and left a sign and then went toward the mountains over bare stone again. And the path rose steeply now, so that he panted a little as he went. The sun moved downward toward the bare stone teeth of the mountains, and Kino set his direction for a dark and shadowy cleft in the range. If there were any water at all, it would be there where he could see, even in the distance, a hint of foliage. And if there were any passage through the smooth stone range, it would be by this same deep cleft.

High in the gray stone mountains, under a frowning peak, a little spring bubbled out of a rupture in the stone. It was fed by shade-preserved snow in the summer, and now and then it died completely and bare rocks and dry algae were on its bottom. But nearly always it gushed out, cold and clean and lovely. In the times when the quick rains fell, it might become a freshet and send its column of white water crashing down the mountain cleft, but nearly always it was a lean little spring. It bubbled out into a pool and then fell a hundred feet to another pool, and this one, overflowing, dropped again, so that it continued, down and down, until it came to the rubble of the upland, and there it disappeared altogether. There wasn\u2019t much left of it then anyway, for every time it fell over an escarpment the thirsty air drank it, and it splashed from the pools to the dry vegetation. The animals from miles around came to drink from the little pools, and the wild sheep and the deer, the pumas and raccoons, and the mice- all came to drink.

The sun had passed over the stone mountains when Kino and Juana struggled up the steep broken slope and came at last to the water. From this step they could look out over the sunbeaten desert to the blue Gulf in the distance. They came utterly weary to the pool, and Juana slumped to her knees and first washed Coyotito's face and then filled her bottle and gave him a drink. And the baby was weary and petulant, and he cried softly until Juana gave him her breast, and then he \u00b0 gurgled and clucked against her. Kino drank long and thirstily at the pool. For a moment, then, he stretched out beside the water and relaxed all his muscles and watched Juana feeding the baby, and then he got to his feet and went to the edge of the step where the water slipped over, and he searched the distance carefully. His eyes set on a point and he became rigid. Far down the slope he could see the two trackers; they were little more than dots or scurrying ants and behind thema larger ant. Juana had turned to look at him and she saw his back stiffen. \u201cHow far?\" she asked quietly. \"They will be here by evening,\u201d said Kino.

He slipped off his sandals and clambered up to them, gripping the bare stone with his toes, and he looked into the shallow caves. They were only a few feet deep, wind-hollowed scoops, but they sloped slightly downward and back. Kino crawled into the largest one and lay down and knew that he could not be seen from the outside. Quickly he went back to Juana. \u201cYou must go up there. Perhaps they will not find us there,\u201d he said. Without question she filled her water bottle to the top, and then Kino helped her up to the shallow cave and brought up the packages of food and passed them to her. And Juana sat in the cave entrance and watched him. She saw that he did not try to erase their tracks in the sand. Instead, he climbed up the brush cliff beside the water, clawing and tearing at the ferns and wild grape as he went. And when he had climbed a hundred feet to the next bench, he came down again. He looked carefully at the smooth rock shoulder toward the cave to see that there was no trace of passage, and last he climbed up and crept into the cave beside Juana. \"When they go up,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will slip away, down to the lowlands again. | am afraid only that the baby"

The two trackers scurried about on the little beach, and they saw Kino\u2019s progress up the cliff before they drank. The man with the rifle sat down and rested himself, and the trackers squatted near him, and in the evening the points of their cigarettes glowed and receded. And then Kino could see that they were eating, and the soft murmur of their voices came to him. Then darkness fell, deep and black in the mountain cleft. The animals that used the pool came near and smelled men there and drifted away again into the darkness. He heard a murmur behind him. Juana was whispering, \u201cCoyotito.\u201d She was begging him to be quiet. Kino heard the baby whimper, and he knew from the muffled sounds that Juana had covered his head with her shawl. Down on the beach a match flared, and in its momentary light Kino saw that two of the men were sleeping, curled up like dogs, while the third watched, and he saw the glint of the rifle in the match light. And then the match died, but it left a picture on Kino\u2019s eyes. He could see it, just how each man was, two sleeping curled up and the third squatting in the sand with the rifle between his knees. Kino moved silently back into the cave. Juana's eyes were two sparks reflecting a low star. Kino crawled quietly close to her and he put his lips near to her cheek. \u201cThere is a way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they will kill you.\u201d \u201cIf | get first to the one with the rifle,\u201d Kino said, \"I must get to him first, then I will be all right.

His own brown skin was a better protection for him.

The night seemed a little less dark when she looked out, and to the east there was a lightening in the sky, down near the horizon where the moon would show. And, looking down, she could see the cigarette of the man on watch. Kino edged like a slow lizard down the smooth rock shoulder. He had turned his neck-string so that the great knife hung down from his back and could not clash against the stone. His spread fingers gripped the mountain, and his bare toes found support through contact, and even his chest lay against the stone so that he would not slip. For any sound, a rolling pebble or a sigh, a little slip of flesh on rock, would rouse the watchers below. Any sound that was not germane to the night would make them alert. But the night was not silent; the little tree frogs that lived near the stream twittered like birds, and the high metallic ringing of the cicadas filled the mountain cleft. And Kino\u2019s own music was in his head, the music of the enemy, low and pulsing, nearly asleep. But the Song of the Family had become as fierce and sharp and feline as the snarl of a female puma. The family song was alive now and driving him down on the dark enemy. The harsh cicada seemed to take up its melody, and the twittering tree frogs called little phrases of it.

If the watcher, sensing movement, looked at the dark place against the stone which was his body, he could see him. Kino must move so slowly he would not draw the watcher's eyes. It took hima long time to reach the bottom and to crouch behind a little dwarf palm. His heart thundered in his chest and his hands and face were wet with sweat. He crouched and took great slow long breaths to calm himself. Only twenty feet separated him from the enemy now, and he tried to remember the ground between. Was there any stone which might trip him in his rush? He kneaded his legs against cramp and found that his muscles were jerking after their long tension. And then he looked apprehensively to the.east. The moon would rise in a few moments now, and he must attack before it rose.

Kino was in mid-leap when the gun crashed and the barrel-flash made a picture on his eyes. The great knife swung and crunched hollowly. It bit through neck and deep into chest, and Kino was a terrible machine now. He grasped the rifle even as he wrenched free his knife. His strength and his movement and his speed were a machine. He whirled and struck the head of the seated man like a melon. The third man scrabbled away like a crab, slipped into the pool, and then he began to climb frantically, to climb up the cliff where the water penciled down. His hands and feet threshed in the tangle of the wild grapevine, and he whimpered and gibbered as he tried to get up. But Kino had become as cold and deadly as steel. Deliberately he threw the lever of the rifle, and then he raised the gun and aimed deliberately and fired. He saw his enemy tumble backward into the pool, and Kino strode to the water.

Tree frogs and cicadas were silent now. And then Kino's brain cleared from its red concentration and he knew the sound- the keening, moaning, rising hysterical cry from the little cave in the side of the stone mountain, the cry of death. Everyone in La Paz remembers the return of the family; there may be some old ones who saw it, but those whose fathers and whose grandfathers told it to them remember it nevertheless. It is an event that happened to everyone. It was late in the golden afternoon when the first tittle boys ran hysterically in the town and spread the word that Kino and Juana were coming back. And everyone hurried to see them. The sun was settling toward the western mountains and the shadows on the ground were long. And perhaps that was what left the deep impression on those who saw them. The two came from the rutted country road into the city, and they were not walking in single file, Kino ahead and Juana behind, as usual, but side by side. The sun was behind them and their long shadows stalked ahead, and they seemed to carry two towers of darkness with them.

The people say that the two seemed to be removed from human experience; that they had gone through pain and had come out on the other side; that there was almost a magical protection about them.

Juan Tomas raised his hand in greeting and did not say the greeting and left his hand in the air for a moment uncertainly. In Kino\u2019s ears the Song of the Family was as fierce as a cry. He was immune and terrible, and his song had become a battle cry. They trudged past the burned square where their house had been without even looking at it. They cleared the brush that edged the beach and picked their way down the shore toward the water. And they did not look toward Kino's broken canoe. And when they came to the water's edge they stopped and stared out over the Gulf. And then Kino laid the rifle down, and he dug among his clothes, and then he held the great pearl in his hand.

Kino and Juana watched it go, winking and glimmering under the setting sun. They saw the little splash in the distance, and they stood side by side watching the place for a long time. And the pearl settled into the lovely green water and dropped toward the bottom. The waving branches of the algae called to it and beckoned to it. The lights on its surface were green and lovely. It settled down to the sand bottom among the fern-like plants. Above, the surface of the water was a green mirror. And the pearl lay on the floor of the sea.

He won the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature \u201cfor his realistic and imaginative writings, combining as they do sympathetic humor and keen social perception\u201d. He has been called \u201ca giant of American letters.\u201d During his writing career, he authored 33 books, with one book coauthored alongside Edward Ricketts, including 16 novels, six non-fiction books, and two collections of short stories. He is widely known for the comic novels Tortilla Flat (1935) and Cannery Row (1945), the multi-generation epic y East of Eden (1952), and the novellas The Red Pony (1933) and Of Mice and Men (1937). The Pulitzer pf Prize-winning The Grapes of Wrath (1939)is considered Steinbeck\u2019s masterpiece and part of the American literary canon. By the 75th anniversary of its publishing date, it had sold 14 million copies. Most of Steinbeck\u2019s work is set in central California, particularly in the Salinas Valley and the California Coast Ranges region. His works frequently explored the themes of fate and injustice, especially as applied to downtrodden or everyman protagonists. (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John Steinbeck) 188"

    "text": "Summary: The Pearl takes place in a small village on the outskirts of La Paz, California. It begins in the brush house of Kino, Juana, and their baby, Coyotito, a family of Mexican Native Americans. In the midst of Kino and Juana\u2019s morning routine, Coyotito is stung by a scorpion that has fallen into his hanging box. Aware of how poisonous the scorpion's sting is, Juana orders that the doctor be gotten and when the doctor refuses to come to them, insists they go to the doctor themselves. Kino, Juana, Coyotito, and their neighbors proceed together to the city. When the servant reports their arrival at his gate, the doctor, lounging indulgently in bed, is insulted by the mere notion that he would \u201ccure insect bites for \u2018little Indians\u201d without compensation. The servant informs Kino that the doctor will not be able to see them and Kino punches the gate, infuriated by the doctor's evident discrimination. Kino and Juana set off in their canoe to search for pearls. Kino dives down to the seafloor and finds one oyster lying alone, gleaming from within. Upon returning to the canoe, Kino opens this oyster last and finds within it the most perfect pearl in the world. News of Kino\u2019's pearl spreads rapidly through the town, inspiring desire and envy in everyone who hears of it. When Juan Tomas asks Kino what he will do as a rich man, he responds that he and Juana will be married in a church, that they will have new clothes, that he will have a rifle, and that his son will receive an education. The priest visits the brush house to remind Kino and Juana to thank God. Then the doctor, inspired by the news of the pearl, arrives in order to treat the baby. He"

Then the doctor, inspired by the news of the pearl, arrives in order to treat the baby. He administers a first treatment and predicts that the poison will strike within the hour. Within the hour, Coyotito indeed becomes ill and the doctor administers a second treatment to cure him. Kino promises to pay the doctor after selling the pearl, which the doctor feigns not to have heard about. That night, after dark, Kino hears noises in the house and manages to strike a thief looking for the pearl with his knife, but is also struck in return, Juana begs, to no avail, that they get rid of the pearl. The next day, Kino and Juana, followed by their neighbors, go to visit the pearl dealers. The first dealer Kino visits assesses the pearl at a mere 1000 pesos, declaring it too big and clumsy to be worth anything more, though it is clearly more valuable than he lets on. Kino accuses the dealer of cheating him, so the dealer instructs Kino to ask around for other appraisals, which are even worse than the first. Kino concludes that he's been cheated and decides to go to the capital for a better estimate. That night, Kino fights off another attacker. Juana tries to throw the pearl into the ocean, but Kino follows her, rips the pearl away from her, and beats her to the ground.

The family retreats into a cave on a mountainside, under which the trackers come to rest at night. When it\u2019s completely dark, Kino prepares to attack them but, as he is about to, Coyotito lets out a cry, provoking one of the trackers to shoot at what he assumes to be a coyote.

Subject: Repair of the road in Rawalpindi Sir, \u00b0 | would like to bring to your notice that the people in and around Rawalpindi have been facing difficulties in travelling back and forth because of the bad condition of the roads there. We have appealed to the Municipality, but there has not been any response on the issue so far. As our appeals to their office have had no effect, we believe that perhaps a mention in the media would be of great help. Since the beginning of the last month, the roads in Rawalpindi have been almost impassable. The surface is badly broken up by the heavy rains, and on a dark night, it is positively dangerous for vehicles to pass that way. Moreover, there are heaps of road metal on both sides of the road, which leave very little room in the middle. The residents of the area have been inconvenienced in this way for weeks. The situation is becoming worse. There have been multiple accidents happening due to this condition. | request you to highlight the seriousness of the matter in your newspaper so that the road may be properly repaired without further delay. Thanking You : Yours sincerely, Signature Ali Ahmed Resident Task: Write a letter to newspaper editor tell him about the increasing street crimes rates in your city and suggest him some steps to control these crimes as soon as possible.

    "text": "Application of Mathematics Functions and Graphs: Functions represent relationships between variables and their graphs provide a visual representation of these relationships. They are used to study trends like profit versus cost in businesses, population growth over time or changes in speed in physics. Functions help in predicting outcomes and analyzing real-world data effectively. Limit, Continuity and Derivative: Limits describe how functions behave near specific points, continuity ensures smooth graphs without breaks, and derivatives measure rates of change like speed or growth. These concepts are essential in physics to calculate instantaneous velocity, in economics for cost optimization and in biology for population growth modeling. Integration: Integration helps calculate areas under curves, volumes, or accumulated quantities. It is widely used to determine total distance from velocity, analyze energy consumption and compute areas in construction projects. Integration also has applications in physics, such as finding work done by a variable force. Differential Equations: Differential equations describe changes in dynamic systems, modeling real-world processes like population growth, chemical reactions and motion. They are used in engineering to design systems, in physics to describe heat flow or wave motion and in biology to model disease spread. Kinematics of Motion in a Straight Line: This studies the motion of objects along a straight path using concepts like displacement, velocity and acceleration. Applications include calculating stopping distances of vehicles, analyzing free- fall under gravity and predicting the motion of objects in linear transport systems."

The set A is called the domain of the function and the set B is called the co-domain of the function. Mathematically, it is written as f : A > B and is read as f is a function from A to B. For example, if we are given two sets A = {\u20141, 1, 2} and B = {1, 4, 9}, f then f = {(\u20141, 1), (1, 1), (2, 4)} isa function because each element of the & \u00ae& set A is assigned to exactly one element of the set B. i.e. there is no A B : repetition in the first element of ordered pairs in f. The first element of each ordered pair in f is called pre-image while its corresponding second ee element is called image of the first element. For example, in (2, 4), 2 is the ( = 2 pre-image of 4 and 4 is the image of 2. If x is independent variable and y is dependent variable, then in general, a function f from A to B is written as f (x) = y. For example, in the above example, f(-1) =1,f(1) =1 and f(2)=4. Explanation: As discussed above, a function relates an input to an output. For example, if a tree grows 15 cm every year and the height A of the tree is related to its age as follows: A(age) = age x 15 then the height of the tree after 10 year is (10) = 10.\u00ab 15 = 150 cm . h(10) = 150\u2019 is like saying 10 is related to 150 or 10 \u2014 150 Here, 10 is the input and 150 is the output"

The table shows that, as x approaches to \u20144 from either the left or right, the functional values f(x) approaches to 8. That is, when x is near \u20144, f(x) is near 8. We say 8 is the limit of f(x) as x approaches to \u20144. We can write as: 16-x\u00b0 : \u20148 \u2014 \u20144 or lim \u2014\u2014\u2014 =8 F(x) as x or lim atx aes Cae Forx +\u20144, f can be simplified by cancellation f(x) = 16=x' (4+xK4\u2014%) 4+x 4+x The graph of / is essentially the graph of y = 4-.x with the exception that the graph of / has a hole at the point that corresponds to x = \u20144.

When, say, a bus travels 60 miles in one hour, the average velocity of the bus must have been 60 mil/hr.

In this section we will develop the concept of limits, continuity, derivative and extrema of function for use in real world problems. Another important application of the derivative is to find solution of the optimization problems. For example, if time is the main consideration in a problem, we might be interested in finding the quickest way to perform a task and if cost is the main consideration we might be interested in finding the least expensive way to perform a task. Mathematically, optimization problem can be reduced to finding the largest or smallest value of a function on some interval and determining where the largest and smallest values occurs.

    "text": "\"TE __UNTT03: INTEGRATION I \u20183.1 Integration This unit examines the process by which we determine functions from their derivatives. We are already familiar with inverse operations. For example, addition and subtraction are inverse of each other. Similarly, multiplication and division are inverse of each other. In the same way, the inverse operation of differentiation is anti-differentiation or integration. This unit provides two processes and their relationship to one another. One step is to find function from their derivatives. In the second step, we can determine things like area and volume through successive approximations. This process is called integration. This is very important area in \u00e9 mathematics and was discovered independently by Leibnitz and Newton. The process of finding a function from one of its known values and its derivative f(x) has two steps: The first is to find a formula that gives us all the functions that could possibly have f(x) as a derivative. If f\u2019(x) is defined as derivative, then f(x) is called anti-derivative and the formula that gives them all is called the indefinite integral of f (x). The reverse process of derivative or anti- differentiation is the main topic of this unit. Definition 3.1: A function F'(x) is called an anti-derivative of another function f(x) if: F(x) = f(@) For example: 14 1 4 at. 1.4 : 7x 7* +3, qe +e (c is any constant.) are anti-derivatives of x\u2019 since the derivative ofeach is\u2019. Above example shows that a function can have many anti-derivatives. In fact, if F(x) is any anti- derivative of f(x) and cis any constant, then F(x) + c is also an anti-derivative of f(x) since: = (F(x) + c] = S[F@)] + lel = f@) + 0= f@) Therefore, if F(x) is any anti-derivative of f(x) on a given interval, then for"

It is an integration technique which involves making a substitution to,simplify the integral. In this method any given integral is transformed into a simple form of integral by substituting the independent variable by others. The exact substitution depends on the form of the given integral, as some substitutions are more appropriate for certain problems than others. The choice of substitution is not always immediately obvious. The ability to recognise an appropriate substitution comes from practising many different examples. Mostly, we substitute trigonometric functions in place of variables to integrate algebraic functions. However, there is no hard and fast rule for selection of trigonometric functions to replace variables as some other substitutions are also used. GRADE 12 TR EM"

Using this formula, we integrate the product of two functions. The important thing to use this formula is the selection of given functions given in the product as a first or second function. The function whose integration can easily be found is considered as the second function while the first function is chosen whose derivative could be easily found.

Let D(x) and S(x) be the number of units demanded and the number of units supplied, respectively, when the commodity sells ata price x per unit. Ifthe demand equals the supply: D(x) = S(x) The market is said to be in equilibrium and the corresponding price of the commodity is called the equilibrium price. If p is the equilibrium price and b is the price at iy the demand of the commodity is zero (b (s)= 0), the integral: Cs = { D(x)dx P is called the consumer surplus.

The formulation of mathematical models is basically to address real-world problems which have been one of the most important aspects of applied mathematics. Differential equations arise in many areas of science and technology, specifically whenever a relation involving some continuously varying quantities and their rates of change in space and/or time (expressed as derivatives). This is illustrated in classical mechanics, where the motion of a body is described by its position and velocity as the time varies. Newton's laws allow relating the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on a body and state this relation as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time. Such equations are called differential equations. A mathematical model is a mathematical construction such as a differential equation, that simulates a natural engineering phenomenon. Most applications of differential equations take the form of mathematical models. For example, consider the problem of determining the velocity v of a falling object. Newton's second law of motion tells us that the net force on the object is equal to the product of the mass, m and its acceleration, = dv t Moet =F This law is a differential equation as it contains derivative. Ignoring air resistance, for an object falling close to the Earth's surface the force is F = mg, directed downward, where g is approximately 9.80 meters per second per second, Thus, the differential equation: dv m= = mg is amathematical model corresponding to the free-falling object.

If only a magnitude is required to express a quantity, then the quantity is known as scalar and if both magnitude and direction are required to express a quantity then the quantity is known as vector quantity. e.g. time, distance, mass are scalars and velocity, acceleration, weight are vectors. 5.1.1 Distance Distance is a scalar quantity since it only describes how much path is covered by a moving object regardless of direction. For example, you travel 3Km due north and then 2km due west then the total path covered is Skm. 5.1.2 Speed Speed is also a scalar quantity since it represents how fast an object is moving regardless of its direction. For example, if you drive a car at the speed of 50km/hr it represents how fast you are moving no matter you are moving in which direction. 5.1.3 Displacement B Change in position of an object is known as displacement. It is a vector quantity because it includes both the magnitude i.e. distance between the initial position and final position and the direction i.e. straight path from the initial position to the final position. For example if you move al along a curved path going from A to B then the straight path AB is the displacement. i: Pisani Dhl . 5.14 Velocity Velocity is also a vector quantity, since it describes both how fast and in which direction an object is moving. In other words, rate of change of displacement with respect to time is called velocity.

First of all, we will discuss that what is a right circular cone and a plane. When the line segment OP rotates about the circumference of a circle of any radius greater than zero with O as fixed point the shape formed is called a right circular cone. The fixed point O is called the vertex of the cone. The ray OA is called the axis of the cone, as OA is perpendicular to the radius AP of the circle that's why this cone is called right circular cone. The line segment OP (or any line segment) which join the point O with the circumference of the circle.is called generator (ruling). Note that a flat or two-dimensional surface that extends indefinitely is called a O plane. Circle: When we cut a cone with a plane so that plane is perpendicular to the axis of cone and not passing through vertex then the intersection isa circle. Parabola: When we cut a cone with the plane such that plane is parallel to any generator or ruling not passing through the vertex then the intersection is a parabola. Ellipse: When we cut a cone with the plane such that plane is slightly tilted not passing through the vertex then the intersection is an ellipse.

Inverse Trigonometric Functions play a crucial role in mathematics, particularly in calculus, geometry, and engineering, by enabling the determination of angles from known trigonometric function values. These functions are also essential in fields such as physics, engineering, and computer graphics. They are widely used to solve equations involving trigonometric functions, analyze periodic phenomena, and develop algorithms for 3D rendering and modeling. A solid understanding of these functions and their properties allows us to address complex problems in both theoretical and applied mathematics, making them a powerful tool in any mathematician's toolkit.

It allows the problem solver to interpret and understand the relationship visually between two variable quantities. Graphs provide an intuitive way to analyze the behavior, identify the trend and solve problems. Graphing becomes valuable in case of inverse trigonometric functions, where the restricted domain and range were not enough to understand the problem. Plotting these graphs, we gain insights the characteristics, such as symmetry, continuity, and asymptotic behavior.

    "text": "Preface This Model Textbook for Mathematics Grade 11 has been developed by NBF according to the National Curriculum of Pakistan 2022-2023. The aim of this textbook is to enhance learning abilities through inculcation of logical thinking in learners, and to develop higher order thinking processes by systematically building the foundation of learning from the previous grades. A key emphasis of the present textbook is creating real life linkage of the concepts and methods introduced. This approach was devised with the intent of enabling students to solve daily life problems as they grow up in the learning curve and also to fully grasp the conceptual basis that will be built in subsequent grades. After amalgamation of the efforts of experts and experienced authors, this book was reviewed and finalized after extensive reviews by professional educationists. Efforts were made to make the contents student friendly and to develop the concepts in interesting ways. The National Book Foundation is always striving for improvement in the quality of its textbooks. The present textbook features an improved design, better illustration and interesting activities relating to real life to make it attractive for young learners. However, there is always room for improvement, the suggestions and feedback of students, teachers and the community are most welcome for further enriching the subsequent editions of this textbook. .

In mathematics the need of complex numbers is to solve the polynomials which do not have the solution in the set of real numbers. e.g., The polynomial x? \u2014 1 = 0 has the solutions x = +1, which are the real numbers. But the polynomial x? + 1 = 0 do not have any solution in the set of real numbers, since there is no real number, whose square is \u20141. To overcome this difficulty, we extended the set of real numbers to the set of complex numbers by introducing a number i such that i? = \u20141 or i = Y\u20141 .

A complex number is denoted by z, i.e., z = x + iy and the set of all complex numbers is denoted by C .The complex number x + iy is also denoted by the ordered pair (x, y).The reason for this notation is justified since there is one to one corresponding between x + ty and (x, y). Clearly i = 0 + i = (0,1) and 1 = 1+ 0i = (1,0) 1.1.1 Real and Imaginary Parts of a Complex Number Every complex numberz=x-+ iy has two parts x and y. x is called the real part and yis called the imaginary part i.e., Re(z) = x and Jm(z) = y. If the real part of a complex number is zero then it is called pure imnaginary number and if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero then it is called real number. Since every real number x can be written as x + i0 thus every real number is a complex number but note that every complex number need not be a real number. Only the complex numbers with zero imaginary part are real numbers. Thus, the set of real number is a subset of set of complex numbers, i.e., Rc C.

Example 9: Find the conjugate of z = (1 + i)(2 \u2014 i).

Draw perpendicular from P on the real axis. It is clear that PAO is a right-angled triangle. So, by using Pythagoras theorem; we have [OP|\" = [oa|\" + [AP = |z)? =x? +y? => |z| = /x? +? which is the magnitude of the complex number z. Also, |z| = (Re(z))* + (Im(z))* Obviously |z| is the distance of z = (x, y) from origin.

Theorem: If z is acomplex number then |z| = 0 and |z| = 0 iffz = 0. Proof: Let z = x + iy; then |z| = /x? + y?, where x and y are real. Since the square of any real number is always non-negative. Thus, value of x? + y is non-negative, also square-root of the non-negative number is non-negative. Hence 7 x? + y? is non-negative; i.e.; |z| = 0.

These applications are of higher level so will be discussed in higher classes. Here we are going to use the complex numbers by giving an easy example of the simple harmonic motion. In simple harmonic motion we have to determine the position of the microscopic particle from its mean position. The equation which gives the position of the particle from mean position is \u2018 1 (8 (1) X = Xmaxe Where x is the displacement of the particle from mean position, Xmax is the amplitude and e'\u00ae = cos 6 + isin@ is the complex number. It is also called Eular\u2019s equation. : Example 25: A micro particle is performing to and fro motion. Find its position at an angle of - \u2018 when its amplitude is 0.05mm. Solution: We are given Xmax = 0.05 ' a and @= z Using the formula X = Xn? = i = x = 0.05e'7 = 0.05 (cos + isin 5) x = 0.05(0 + i) = 0.05i It means particle is at the position where we cannot see it but just think about it. The above formula can also be written as x = Xmaxe'\u201d\u00ae where wis the angular velocity and t is \u2018 the time. Also w = 27 where fis the frequency of the particle.

Apply concepts of matrices to real world problems such as (graphic design, data encryption, sctsmic analysis, cryptography, transformation of geometric shapes, social network analysis). A very common use of matrices in daily life is encryption. We use:them to scramble data for security purpose and to encode and decode this data. There is a key that helps encode and decode data which is generated by matrices. The screen of any electronic device, like smart phone or LED TV screen is essentially a pixel matrix. When we rotate the phone and it is in landscape form; the matrix is actually rotated using the transpose. When we touch the screen of a cell phone at some specific position; the position is calculated by matrix properties. In mathematics we use matrices to solve the system of linear equations.

For this consider an identity matrix / of same order as that of A. Write A and / parallel to each other. Now perform same row operations on A and J so that matrix A reduce to /, consequently the matrix / will also reduce to some new matrix which is the inverse of A.

Similarly, the equation of the form a,x, + @2X2z + @3X3 = k2; where a,,@2,a, and k; are constants and at least one of a,, a2 and a3 is non-zero is called a linear equation in three variables X1,Xz and x3. In the same manner we can extend this for n number of variables. System of Linear Equations When we deal with more than one linear equation at the same time; then it is called system of linear equations. We divide the system of linear equations into two categories: (i) Homogeneous system of linear equations.

For this we consider three mutually perpendicular lines interesting at a common point O known as origin. Any point in the space has some specific position w. r. t. origin O i.e., We can locate the point by moving specific distance along these three lines. These three lines are known as coordinate axes and x-axis are named as x-axis, y-axis and z-axis. The distance 2 along x-axis is called x-coordinate, the distance along y-axis is y-coordinate and the distance along z-axis is z-coordinate of the point. A general point in the space has coordinate (x, y, z). This coordinate system to represent or locate a point is known as rectangular coordinate system or Cartesian coordinate system and is denoted by R x R x R or R3. The set of all the points in mae R3 = {(x, y,Z):X)y, Zz E R}. 3.2.2 Unit Vectors i,j and k 4 To represent a vector in space we need unit vectors in the direction of coordinate axes.

Vector images maintain their quality irrespective of size. This adaptability makes vector file formats flexible, resilient, and always looking sharp. Vector artwork is digital art produced with vector design software like Linearity Curve (formerly Vectornator), Adobe Illustrator, and Sketch. These vector graphics editors generate simple shapes between points instead of pixels. , Programing: A vector, in programming, is a type of array that is one dimensional. Vectors are a logical element in programming languages that are used for storing a sequence of data elements of the same basic type. Members of a vector are called components.

The first term is symbolized by ay, the second term by a, and so on to a,, the nth term. The sequence shown in the table contains ten terms. Therefore, a;=119.9, ag= 128.6 and ay9 = 198.2 (each term is obtained by adding 8.7 to the previous term). A sequence of this type is called an arithmetic sequence or arithmetic progression(A.P). The number added to find the next term of an arithmetic sequence is called the common difference and is symbolized by the variable d. * Explanation: In as arithmetic sequence, all terms (other than the first) can be found by adding the same number to the preceding term. For example, the sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, ... is arithmetic because adding 3 to any term produces the next term. In other words, the difference between any term and the proceeding one is 3. Arithmetic panes are also called arithmetic progressions (A.P). \u2018 To find the next terms in an arithmetic sequence, first find the common difference d by subtracting any term from its succeeding term, then add the common difference to the last term to find successive terms, - Example 3: Find the next four terms of the arithmetic sequence 33, 39, 45...

A patient is given a compound containing the radioactive iodine. The amount of iodine retained by this gland is a measure of its ability to function. Iodine has a half-life of about 8 days. That means approximately every 8 days, half the mass of iodine decays into another element. Then in the next 8 days, half of the remaining iodine decays, and so on. Suppose a container hold a mass of 64 milligrams of iodine. To find the remaining mass of iodine after each half-life, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, and 0.5, are what type of patterns do you suggest? The pattern of masses forms a sequence of numbers known as a geometric sequence or geometric progression. The terms in this example are 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, and 0.5.

Consider the sequence: 2, 6, 18, 54, 162,... If we multiply each term by 3, we obtain the next term. Sequence in which term cab be multiplied by a certain number in order to get the next term are called geometric. We call this multiplier the \u2018common ratio\u2019 because it is found be dividing any term by the preceding term. In any geometric sequence, the common ratio r is found by dividing any term by the previous term. Example 13: Find the next two terms of the geometric sequence 4, 12,.and 36.

Most of the society and reality around us is based upon sequence after sequence, changing and repeating themselves over and over again. Common examples of this are time and calendrical system. Time (seconds, minutes, hours) always follow the same sequence, which always contains the same number of elements. Our lives are ruled over by sequences such as the routines that we follow every day without knowing leading to their great importance in the structure and function of the modern world. Example 36: Khalid is saving for a new car. He deposits Rs. 100,000 into his account and then each month he deposits in Rs. 10,000 more than the month before. If the price of the car is Rs. 1,260,000; find: The amount Khalid has saved in four months. The time in which Khalid reaches his goal of Rs. 1,260,000. Solution: Since Khalid deposits same amount every month, therefore, we will use arithmetic series. Let a, = 100000, d= 10000, 5 ,=? S, = 5(2a+(n-1d] S,=5[2(a)+ (4-H) S, = 2[2(100000)+ (3)10000] S, = 460000 Therefore, amount saved in 4 months = Rs. 460,000 ii. Let Sa = 126,0000, d= 10000, a = 100000, n=?

Conclusion: If p(x) = x 6\u00b0 + 14x \u2014 8 <\u2014 dividend d(x) =x-2 \u00ab< divisor then, remainder = p(2) = 4 Statement: If a polynomial p(x) is divided by x\u2014 c (where c is a constant), then the remainder is p(c). Proof: Let q(x) be the quotient and r be the remainder. When p(x) is divided by (x \u2014 c), then p(x)= (x-c) q(x) tr...... (i) We know that: Substituting x =c in result (i) , we have dividend = quotient x divisor + remainder. p(c)=(c-c)q(c)+r =0+r =r, which is the remainder.

A coin has two outcomes that is head and tail while a die has six outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Then the outcomes of tossing a coin and rolling a die are These outcomes are 12 in number. We can also find this number 12 without listing all outcomes. We know that a coin has two outcomes while a die has six outcomes. So, the total outcomes are the product of values of two things that is 2 x 6 = 12."

If we have three objects A, B and C which can happened in m, nm and p ways respectively. Then tlie triplet (A, B, C) can be written in m X n X p or mnp ways. In this unit, we will develop formulae and techniques for counting the number of objects. Then these formulae will be used to calculate the number of arrangements of the objects. 6.2 Factorial Notation Factorial notation was introduced by French mathematician Christian Kramp in 1808.

Sage ei 6-choices 5-choices 4-choices 3-choices For the first digit, we have 6 choices of digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. For the second digit, we have 5- choices; because the selected digit cannot be selected again. Similarly, for the third digit, there are 4-choices and for the fourth digit, we are left with 3-choices. So, the total number of plates = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 = 360 Example 4: Suppose a student has four different subject\u2019s books and wish to arrange them on a shelf. In how many ways he can arrange the books, can be counted as follows.

To establish the connection between this visualization and the principle of mathematical induction, consider the sentence \"The nth domino falls backward\", denoted as P(n).

How the Pascal triangle is helpful in the binomial expansion; observe some positive integral powers of (a + b)\u201d. forn =1 (a+b)'=a+b forn = 2 (a + b)? = a* + 2ab + b? forn = 3 (a + b)\u00ae = a\u00ae + 3a*b + 3ab? + b forn = 4 (a + b)* = a* + 4a\u00b0b + 6a*b? + 4ab3 + bt Observe that the binomial coefficients in the above expansion are. forn = 1 1 1 forn = 2 1 2 1 forn = 3 1 3 3 1 forn = 4 1 a 6 4 1 Which are same as the first four rows of the Pascal\u2019s triangle. In this way we can find the binomial coefficients from the Pascal triangle by considering its n*\u201d row; for the expansion of (a + b)\". Also from the above expansion note that, expansion starts with a\u201d and in each next term exponent of a is decreased by 1 and the exponent of b is increased by 1.

From the table, the unit place digits for 2 are as 2* = 2, 22 = 4,23 = 8, 2* = 16 and 2\u00b0 = 32. Since the unit digit is same as that of the number 2 therefore the cyclicity of 2 is 5 \u2014 1 =4. In the same manner we can find the cyclicity of other numbers. The cyclicity of 3, 7 and 8 is also 4. For 1, 5 and 6 the unit digit remains the same for all the exponents and for 4 the unit place digit is either 4 or 6 whereas for 9 it is 9 or 1 only. Hence, we can say that if the exponent is of the form 4n, 4n+1, 4n+2 or 4n+3"

    "text": "Gravity, a force that has fascinated scientists for centuries, is essential in shaping the universe. It keeps us firmly held on Earth and controls the movements of stars in galaxies. Newton's law of gravitation has been crucial in helping us comprehend this force. Our galaxy, the Milky-Way, is a prime example of gravity's strength. It is a vast disk of stars, dust, and gas held together by the powerful gravitational force of its center. Even though we are located near the edge of the galaxy, about 26,000 light-years from the center, we are not alone. The Milky-Way is part of the Local Group, a cluster of galaxies that includes the Andromeda Galaxy, just 2.5 million light-years away. Gravity is the master of this cosmic dance. It controls the movements of stars within our galaxy and influences how galaxies interact with each other. As we explore gravity further, we develop a deeper understanding of the force that shapes the universe on large scale. io. 1 NEWTON'S LAW OF UNIVERSAL GRAVITATION Newton formulated a law called the law of universal gravitation to describe the force of attraction between various objects in the universe; which is stated as follows: Every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centres. Newton's law of universal gravitation revolutionized our understanding of the physical world and provided a mathematical framework for explaining the motion of celestial bodies such as planets, moons, and stars. It laid the foundation for the development of classical mechanics and helped to explain many phenomena in the natural world, from the tides caused by the gravitational pull of the moon to the orbiting of planets around the sun.

It took scientists 100 years after Newton's work to create a device capable of measuring G. In 1798, Henry Cavendish, an Englishman, used a torsion balance apparatus (shown in figure) to measure the gravitational force between two objects. This experiment not only helped determine G but also raised questions about whether gravitational force varies in different mediums, such as air and water. Knowing G also led to obtaining precise values for Earth's mass and other astr ical masses. 15.2 GRAVITATIONAL FIELD STRENGTH The area around a massive object (like Earth, sun, etc.) where its gravitational force acts is known as gravitational field. Gravitational field is represented by field lines that indicate the direction and strength of gravity, as shown in Fig. 15.4. Closer lines represent a stronger field, while farther apart lines indicate a weaker field. The gravitational field lines point radially inward uniformly in all directions for a point mass (a point mass is treated as if all its mass is concentrated at a single point in space), forming a symmetric pattern. Since a gravitational force is an interaction between a test mass and the gravitational field created by the source mass, therefore from Newton\u2019s second law of motion: m F Similarly, a,= = =g Gravitational field can be defined by gravitational field strength, denoted by \u2018g\u2019. The gravitational field strength is a vector with a magnitude of \u2018g\u2019 pointing in the direction of the gravitational force. The value of \u2018g\u2019 is the gravitational force on a unit mass at that point, or \u2018g = F,/m\u2019. Therefore, gravitational field strength and acceleration due to gravity are equivalent.

Due to Venus\u2019s lower mass compared to Earth, its Hill sphere is significantly smaller. At a distance of 1,530,000 km, the satellite would likely be outside Venus's Hill sphere and more influenced by the Sun's gravity. This would cause the satellite's orbit to become unstable, and it wouldn't remain stationary over a fixed point on Venus.

However, as we move away from the surface, gravity weakens, making the equation invalid. Instead, we must use an expression based on Newton's law of universal gravitation. Secondly, to calculate gravitational potential energy, we need to establish a zero-reference point, often the Earth's surface. This choice results in negative potential energy for any finite distance \u2018r\u2019 because potential energy decreases as objects move closer to the zero-reference point and increases as they move apart.

SUMMARY & & Newton\u2019s Law of Universal Gravitation: Every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centres. Satellite: A satellite is any object that orbits another object due to the force of gravity, maintaining a stable path around it. Orbital velocity: In circular orbit a satellite has a constant tangential speed called orbital velocity. Geostationary satellite: A geostationary satellite, also Known as a geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO) satellite, is a type of satellite that orbits the Earth directly above the equator at an altitude where its orbital period matches the Earth's rotation period. This results in the satellite appearing stationary relative to a fixed point on the Earth's surface. Absolute gravitational potential energy: The potential energy possessed by a body at a certain height in a gravitational field with respect to reference point of zero potential is known as absolute potential energy.

Statistical mechanics is a branch of physics that applies statistical methods to understand the behavior of physical systems composed of a large number of particles. It offers a framework for understanding the behavior of complex systems, from the microscopic to the macroscopic level. In the present chapter, we shall relate volume, pressure, and temperature to the microscopic properties like speed and kinetic energy of gas molecules. Statistical mechanics is applied to various complex systems, from materials science to biological systems. 16.1 PRESSURE EXERTED BY GAS MOLECULES The molecules of a gas are in a state of continuous random motion in a container. They collide with one another and also with the walls of the container. Due to collisions of gas molecules with the walls, their momentum changes. Due to their elastic collisions, they transfer an equal amount of momentum to the walls of the container. According to Newton\u2019s second law of motion, the rate of transfer of momentum (Ap/At) by the gas molecules to the walls is equal to the force (F) exerted on the wall.

Gas that obeys the ideal gas law (PV = n RT) is called an ideal gas. The ideal gas law governs macroscopic properties, e.g., temperature, pressure, volume, quantity of gas, and entropy. Although there is no such thing in nature asa truly ideal gas, gases can approach the ideal state at low pressure and high temperatures. We have seen that the temperature of an ideal gas can be determined as T = 7) . This equation implies that temperature (a macroscopic property of a gas) is defined by the motion of an individual particle (a microscopic quantity). Hence, different results for ideal gas provide connections between its microscopic and macroscopic quantities. This gives rise to a branch of physics called statistical mechanics. Statistical mechanics is a branch of physics that connects the microscopic details of a system, such as motion, energy, and the interaction of individual particles, with the macroscopic observables we measure, such as temperature, pressure, volume, and entropy. Statistical mechanics provides a mathematical foundation for thermodynamics, which is otherwise a phenomenological theory. Behaviour of Non-Ideal Gases The ideal gas law works well for large volumes, high temperatures, and low pressure, but it fails to explain the behavior of gases under high pressure, high density, and low temperature (where molecules"

The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that: Two electrons cannot occupy the same quantum state. Degenerate matter happens when gravity squeezes atoms so tightly under extremely high - pressure in a star that they change from their normal state. Normally, atoms are made up of a nucleus and electrons Gravitational pressure revolving around the nucleus. But when the pressure is extremely high, electrons are strongly pressed tightly against the nucleus in high energy states (according to Pauli Exclusion principle) and they cannot move freely. At this stage, electrons show resistance against gravity and other forces for further compression. This resistance is called degeneracy pressure, which counteract the effect of gravity and other. compressive forces, as shown in Fig. 16.5. So, degenerated matter is matter that is packed so tightly that its electrons are forced into a tightly packed configuration.

Perhaps you've noticed the smooth motion of a child on a swing or the rhythmic movement of a spring-based toy. These phenomena are all connected by a fundamental concept in physics: Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM). SHM can be observed in various natural and man-made systems. It is in the rhythms of nature, how the universe moves, vibration of atoms, mechanical systems that engineers create, and countless other systems from everyday life. In this chapter, we'll delve into the world of SHM, exploring topics such as oscillations, uniform. circular motion, phase of motion, and energy conservation. We'll also examine the differences between free and forced oscillations, and discover the fascinating phenomenon of resonance. Sometimes harmonic motion can cause problems. One famous example is the collapse of Tacoma Narrows Bridge, The bridge was designed by structural engineers who did not adequately take into account the role of harmonic motion and it led into its collapse.

Mathematically, simple harmonic motion is expressed as: anx-\u2014x SHM can be observed in many natural phenomena. A good example.of SHM is motion of mass (m) attached to an elastic spring. The other end of spring is connected to a fixed support, as shown in Fig. 17.3. Let us assume that the mass of spring is ignored and the mass is free to move on a frictionless, horizontal surface. In the absence of an external force, the spring is neither stretched nor compressed. Hence, the mass stays at its equilibrium or mean position, which we identify as x = 0, as shown in Fig. 17.3 (b). Let the mass is stretched towards right through a displacement \u2018x\u2019 from its equilibrium position by applying a force F, as shown in Fig. 17.3 (a). Due to elasticity, spring exerts an opposite force on the mass x=0 which is proportional to the displacement \u2018x\u2019 from Figure 17.3: Mass \u2018m\u2019 oscillates on mean position.

Here we discuss these three types of oscillations in detail. Free Oscillations Every oscillator has a natural frequency of vibration with which it vibrates freely after an initial disturbance. For example, an ideal simple pendulum oscillates freely with its natural frequency, when slightly displaced from its mean position, as shown in Fig.17.8 (a). The natural frequency of pendulum depends on its length. If you change the length of string, you may change its natural frequency. If you pluck a guitar string, it continues to vibrate for some \u00a9) time after you have released it. It vibrates with its natural - frequency and it gives rise to the particular note that you Figure\u201917.8 (a): Illustration of hear.

Damping is the effect of resistive forces which dissipate energy from a vibrating object. When a simple pendulum is being set into oscillatory motion, then after some time, it stops oscillating due to air resistance. All oscillating systems experience such type of resistive force which are known as damping forces. Due to the damping force, amplitude of oscillation decreases over time from one oscillation to the next and eventually stops oscillating. Examples of damping forces can include frictional forces between moving parts, air resistance or internal forces such as those in springs that tend to dissipate energy as heat. Displacement We know that in reality, a spring won't oscillate forever. Frictional forces will diminish the Time amplitude of oscillations until eventually the system comes to rest. If the amplitude of oscillations decreases under damping forces, then such oscillations are called Figure 17.9 (a): Displacement-time damped oscillations. graphs to illustrate undamped oscillations.

When the frequency of driving force gradually increases from zero, the oscillator begins to vibrate with small amplitude. As we increase the frequency, the amplitude of vibration also increases. The closer the deriving frequency to the natural frequency, the more efficiently the driving force transfers energy to the oscillator and the greater the resulting amplitude.

Applications of Resonance in Daily Life Resonance plays very important role in various phenomena of daily life. Here we shall discuss some circumstances in which resonance is useful: Tuning of Radio and Electrical Resonance: When we turn the knob of a radio to tune a station. We are actually changing the natural frequency of the electrical circuit of receiver to make it equal to the transmission frequency of the radio station. When the two frequencies match with \u20acach other, then resonance occurs. In this way, energy absorption from the station is maximum and this is the only station we hear. Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used medical diagnostic tool in which atomic nuclei (mostly hydrogen nuclei) are made to oscillate by incoming strong radio waves (on the order of 100 MHz). When resonance occurs, maximum energy is absorbed by the nuclei. The pattern of energy absorbed can be used to produce computer enhanced photography.

Acoustic levitation provides a container-less environment for some experiments. Acoustic levitation occurs when sound waves interact and create a standing wave with nodes that can trap a particle. Chladni Plates: A chladni plate consists of a flat metal sheet (usually circular or square) mounted on a central stalk attached to a strong base. When the plate oscillates in a particular mode of vibration, the nodes and antinodes that formed produce a complex but symmetrical patterns on its surface. The positions of these nodes and antinodes can be seen by sprinkling sand upon the plates. The sand will vibrate away from the antinodes and gather at the nodes.

SHM is an oscillatory motion in which acceleration of a particle is directly proportional to its displacement from the mean position and is always directed towards the mean position.

A body is said to be executing free oscillation when it oscillates under the influence of restoring force without any external force acting on it. If the external forces make the object oscillating at the frequency of applied force rather than its natural frequency, then such oscillations are called forced oscillations.

    "text": "Have you ever marveled at the vibrant colors of a rainbow, or wondered why sound waves can sometimes cancel each other out, creating silence? These phenomena are a testament to two fascinating wave properties: interference and diffraction. Interference occurs when two or more waves traveling through the same medium interact and superimpose on each other. This interaction can lead to surprising results. Depending on how the waves are aligned, they can either strengthen each other (constructive interference), creating brighter light or louder sound, or cancel each other out (destructive interference), resulting in darkness or quieter sound. Understanding interference allows us to explain everyday occurrences like the beating sound between slightly off-tune instruments and the formation of colorful bands in soap bubbles. Interference isn't limited to light or sound waves. It\u2019s a fundamental property observed in all types of waves, from water ripples in a tank to the intricate quantum waves that make up matter. So, the next time you witness a dazzling rainbow or hear a mesmerizing musical chord, remember, it's all a captivating play of interference. Diffraction, on the other hand, describes the bending of a wave around the edges of an obstacle or through a narrow slit. Unlike reflection, where a wave bounces off a surface, diffraction causes the wave to spread out and travel into regions beyond the obstacle\u2019s shadow. This phenomenon is responsible for the dazzling colors we see in rainbows, where sunlight diffracts through water droplets. Diffraction also plays a crucial role in various technologies like x-ray crystallography, which helps us understand the structure of materials, and optical instruments like diffraction gratings, which separate light into its constituent colors.

Understanding these principles unveils a deeper understanding of the behavior of waves and their remarkable effects in the world around us. 18.1 INTERFERENCE ie e he Two-source interference, also known as double-slit interference, is a phenomenon in which waves from two coherent sources overlap and interfere with each other, creating a pattern of alternating constructive and destructive interference fringes.

Narrow Slits: The slits must be narrow and close together compared to the wavelength of the waves. This ensures that the waves from each slit overlap and interfere with each other. 3. Monochromatic Waves: The waves emitted by the sources should ideally have a single wavelength (monochromatic) to produce a clear interference pattern. 4. Stable Environment: The experimental setup must be free from disturbances such as vibrations or air currents, which could disrupt the wave patterns and interfere with the observation of fringes. By satisfying these conditions, two-source interference fringes can be observed across various wave types, demonstrating the wave nature of light, sound, and other phenomena. 18.1.1 Interference of Water Waves Interference can be demonstrated in a ripple tank by using two-point:sources. In a ripple tank experiment (see Fig. 18:2), two coherent sources are created by generating ripples in the water from two separate point sources. The tank is illuminated from above to enhance visibility. When the waves from both sources meet, they interfere with each other. This interference creates regions of constructive interference, where waves reinforce each other and produce larger waves, and regions of destructive interference, where waves cancel each other out. This results in a pattern of alternating crest and trough on the surface of the water. Interference of two circular waves is shown in Fig. 18.3. If two waves arrive in phase (their crests or trough arrive at exactly the same time), they will interfere constructively. A resultant wave will be produced, which has crests much higher than the two individual waves, and troughs much deeper. lf the two waves arrive in anti-phase (with a phase"

Two speakers emitting coherent sound waves are placed facing a screen, as shown in Fig 18.4. The sound waves from both sources overlap, creating regions of constructive and destructive interference. This interference pattern can be visualized by using a microphone or a detector to measure the intensity of sound at various points on the screen. Consider sound waves from two loudspeakers connected to the same signal generator and amplifier, producing notes of the same frequency. Sound waves being longitudinal waves, consists of compressions and rarefactions. At points such as P;, Ps, Ps, Pe and Ps constructive interference occurs because here compressions or rarefactions align and the sound appears louder. Destructive interference occurs at points such as P2, P3, P7 and Ps, when compression align with a rarefaction and vice versa, resulting in a quieter sound. This principle is used in noise-cancelling headphones (you have studied in grade XI). 18.1.3 Interference of Light Waves In a double-slit experiment with light waves,.a laser beam is typically used as the coherent light source. The light beam is directed through a barrier with two narrow slits (Figure 18.5), creating two coherent sources of light waves. A screen placed behind the slits displays the interference pattern.

Two-source interference experiments using microwaves are a fascinating demonstration of wave physics. These experiments typically involve two coherent microwave sources, i.e. microwaves of the same frequency and phase. When these microwaves overlap, they create an interference pattern characterized by alternating regions of constructive and destructive interference. To observe this pattern, a detector is moved through the various points of interference, registering the intensity of the microwaves. At points of constructive interference, the detector records a higher intensity, while at points of destructive interference, the intensity is significantly lower or even zero. This pattern can be visualized on a screen or through a recording device connected to the detector.

The receiver, which is placed at variable distances and angles from the slits, measures the intensity of the resulting microwaves. The data collected from these experiments can be used to calculate the wavelength of the microwaves, as the distance between the points of maximum or minimum intensity is related to the wavelength and the geometry of the setup. This is a practical application of the principles of wave superposition and interference. These experiments not only demonstrate the wave nature of microwaves but also have practical implications. For instance, understanding microwave interference is crucial in designing microwave communication systems to avoid signal loss due to destructive interference. Moreover, the principles observed in microwave interference are analogous to those in other wave phenomena, including sound waves, water waves, and even quantum mechanics, where particles exhibit wave-like behavior. Thus, two-source interference experiments with microwaves provide a valuable insight into the broader wave phenomena that govern various aspects of the physical world.

When monochromatic light (light of a : single wavelength) illuminates a diffraction grating, the light waves passing through the slits interfere constructively and destructively, creating a pattern of bright and dark fringes, as \u2018shown in Fig. 18.9 (b). The angle at which the bright fringes (maxima) occur depends on the wavelength of light and the spacing between the slits in the grating. This relationship is described by the equation: dsin@=mA Figure 18.9 (b): Diffraction of light through diffraction grating. By measuring the angle of diffraction (6) for a specific order of the bright fringe (m) and knowing the spacing between the slits (d), one can determine the wavelength of light (A). By following this procedure, the wavelength of light can be accurately determined using a diffraction grating, making it a valuable tool in spectroscopy and various scientific applications. An idealized graphs of the intensity of light passing through a double slit and a diffraction grating for monochromatic light is shown in Fig.18.10.

    "text": "SUMMARY *% Interference: The interaction of two or more waves propagating through the same medium, resulting in a superposition effect that can lead to constructive or destructive interference. * Constructive Interference: When the crests (peaks) of two or more waves overlap, they > reinforce each other, producing a resultant wave with a higher intensity (brighter light, louder sound) compared to the individual waves. * Destructive Interference: When the crest of one wave coincides with the trough (valley) of another wave, they cancel each other out partially or completely. This results in a weaker resultant wave with a lower intensity (darkness, quieter sound) compared to the individual waves. Superposition Principle: A fundamental principle in wave physics stating that the resultant wave at any point in space is the sum of the individual waves present at that point. The \u2018individual waves can add up constructively or destructively depending on their relative phases (alignment). Coherent Sources: Waves that have the same frequency and a constant phase relationship are considered coherent. This means the crests and troughs of the waves occur at the same time, allowing for predictable interference patterns. Wavelength (A): The distance between two consecutive crests (or troughs) of a wave. Frequency (f): The number of wave cycles that pass a point in a given unit of time (usually measured in Hertz or Hz). Diffraction: The bending of a wave around the edges of an obstacle or through a narrow slit. Unlike reflection, where the wave bounces off a surface, diffraction causes the wave to spread out and travel into regions beyond the geometrical shadow of the obstacle. Wave front: A surface connecting points in a wave that are in the same phase (at the same point in their cycle). In diffraction, the wave front is altered as it interacts with the"

Slit Width: The width of the opening through which the wave passes in diffraction. The smaller the slit width compared to the wavelength, the more pronounced the diffraction effect will be. Diffraction Grating: A periodic structure with many closely spaced parallel slits or grooves. When light or other waves pass through a diffraction grating, they diffract and create a specific pattern of diffracted beams due to constructive and destructive interference. Diffraction Pattern: The spatial distribution of intensity observed after a wave diffracts around an obstacle or through a slit. This pattern typically consists of alternating bright and dark bands due to constructive and destructive interference of the diffracted waves. Grating Constant (d): The distance between the centers of two adjacent slits (or grooves) in a diffraction grating. The grating constant plays a crucial role in determining the angles at which the diffracted beams emerge.

One needs more energy to move a charge further in the electric field, but also more energy to move it through a stronger electric field. So, there are two factors on which the electric potential energy of an object depends: Its own electric charge and its relative position with other electrically charged objects.

Waa is the work done by the force in carrying a positive charge q from point B to point A without disturbing the equilibrium state of the charge. Unit of electric potential energy is joule ( J ). The concept of electric potential is used to express the effect of an electric field of a source in terms of the location within the electric field. A test charge with twice the quantity of charge would possess twice the potential energy at a given location; yet its electric potential at that location would be the same as any other test charge. A positive test charge would be at a high electric potential when held close to a positive source charge and at a lower electric potential when held further away. In this sense, electric potential becomes simply a property of the location within an electric field. Suppose that the electric potential at a given location is 12 Joules per coulomb, then that is the electric potential of a 1 coulomb or a 2 coulomb charged object. Stating that the electric potential at a given location is 12 joules per coulomb, would mean that a 2 coulomb object would possess 24 joules of potential energy at that location and a 0.5 coulomb object would experience 6 joules of potential energy at"

The unit of capacitance is the farad (F), named for Michael Faraday (1791-1867), an English scientist who contributed to the fields of electromagnetism and electrochemistry. Since capacitance is charge per unit voltage, we see that a farad is a coulomb per volt. If a capacitor stores a charge of 1 coulomb (a Very large amount of charge) having the potential difference of 1 volt between the plates, then the capacitance is called 1farad.

The cell membrane acts like acapacitor that stores energy as electrically charged ions on opposite sides of the cell membrane. . In most solutions, ions of a given electric charge are accompanied by ions of opposite charge, so that the solution itself has no net charge. If two solutions of different concentrations are separated by a membrane that allows one kind of ion to pass but block the other, producing equal and opposite net charges in the two solutions. This concentration imbalance gives rise to an electric-potential difference between the solutions. In living cells, there are two types of solutions: those found inside and outside the cell. The cell membrane (as shown in Fig. 19.9), separating inside from outside, is semipermeable. Cell membrane allows certain ions to pass through while blocking others.

Filtering In a rectifier circuit (as shown in the Fig. 20.8-a), a capacitor smooths out the pulsating direct current (DC) into a more stable, constant output. This process is often referred to as \u2018filtering\u2019. As the voltage rises up to the peak of the input waveform, the capacitor charges to the peak voltage. When the input voltage drops, the capacitor discharges slowly by supplying charge to the load. The capacitor\u2019s discharge helps to fill in the gaps between the peaks of the rectified waveform, thereby reducing the voltage fluctuations and making the output smoother, as shown in the Fig. 20.8 (b). (a) (b) Figure 20.8: (a) Full-wave rectifier with capacitor: (b) smoothing action by capacitor. The choice of capacitance value and load resistance depends on the specific application requirements. A higher capacitance value provides better smoothing, but may increase the charging current. A lower load resistance causes the capacitor to discharge faster, reducing its ability to smooth the output. 20.3. MUTUAL INDUCTANCE AND SELF-INDUCTANCE Self-induction: Consider a coil, which is connected to a source of emf say a battery, through a switch and a rheostat, as shown in Fig. 20.9 (a).

This change in current in the coil, changes the magnetic field, hence the flux through the coil changes, which finally induces an emf in the coil itself. \u2018National Book Foundation (2) 20-Alternating Current."

It is measured in cycle/second or Hertz. \u201c The average value of a waveform is the average of all its values over a period of time. Maximum value of alternating quantity (current or voltage) is called peak value. \u00a2 The r.m.s value of an alternating current is that steady current (d.c.) which when flowing through a resistor produce the same amount of heat as that produced by the alternating current when flowing through the same resistance for the same time. * The process of converting ac voltage into dc voltage is called rectification. * Ina half-wave rectification process an AC signal is converted into DC by passing one half- cycle of the waveform and blocking the second-half. * In full wave rectification, the complete cycle of AC signal is converted into pulsating DC.

This process is often referred to as \u2018filtering\u2019. \u201c The phenomenon, in which a changing current induces an emf in the coil itself, is called self-inductance. Self-inductance of a coil is the ratio of emf induced in the coil to the time rate of change of current through it. Self-inductance of a coil will be one henry, if 1 volt emf is induced in the coil by the change of current at the rate of one ampere per second. * \u00ab The phenomenon, in which changing current in one coil, induces emf in neighboring coil, is called mutual induction. Mutual inductance between two coils is 1 henry if current changing at the rate of 1 A/s in one coil induces an emf of 1 V in the other coil. \u201c The fraction of a period difference between the peaks expressed in degrees is said to be the phase difference. * In an inductor, volage leads the current by : radians or 90\u00b0. * In acapacitor, volage lags the current by = radians or 90\u00b0. \u201c A Choke is an inductor used in.a circuit.

    "text": "Quantum theory is the foundation of Modern Physics. At the smallest scales, the classical laws for real cases no longer apply, so quantum physics explains the nature and behaviour of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. Quantum physics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. In this realm, the rules of classical physics are replaced by strange and counterintuitive phenomena. Quantum physics is not just a curiosity, but has led to countless technological innovations, from transistors and lasers to computer chips and medical imaging. In this chapter, we'll study the fundamental principles and fascinating concepts of quantum physics that help us in exploring our universe. 21.1 ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE In 1864, the British physicist James Clerk Maxwell made the remarkable ideas that accelerated electric charges generate linked electric and magnetic disturbances that can travel through space, as shown in Fig. 21.1. These electric field (E) and magnetic field (B) can sustain each other, forming an electromagnetic wave that propagates through space with speed about 310\u00b0 ms\u2018. The direction of propagation is the direction of the vector product E x B. Electric and magnetic components of an electromagnetic wave are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of motion. Figure 21.1: A pair of electric (red) and magnetic (blue) fields, propagating together as an electromagnetic wave in the direction indicated by the arrow at the speed of light. Visible light emitted by the glowing filament of light bulb is an example of electromagnetic wave.

The electromagnetic wave travels through vacuum or through any specific medium from one point to another point depending on energy. Plank's Quantum Theory Planck's quantum theory is the fundamental theory of quantum mechanics. In 1900, Plank studied the electromagnetic radiation emitted from different atoms and molecules, and proposed a theory which was in complete agreement with experiments at all wavelengths. According to this theory: 1) Different atoms and molecules can emit or absorb energy (E) in discrete amount only, which is given by: E=nhf (21.1) Here n-= 1, 2, 3, .... _is called quantum number, h = 6.626x10\u2122 J s is the plank\u2019s constant and f is the frequency of the radiation. The energies of the molecules are said to be quantized, and the allowed energy state are called quantum states. Atoms or molecules emit or absorb energy only by jumping from one quantum state to another. 2) The smallest amount of energy that can be emitted or absorbed in the form of electromagnetic radiation is known as quantum (plural quanta). The development of Plank's theory gave the birth to the Quantum Physics. Example 21.1: What is the frequency of a photon whose energy is 66.3 eV?

Formulated by the German physicist and Nobel laureate Werner Heisenberg in 1927, the uncertainty principle states that we cannot find both the position and speed of a particle, such as a photon or electron, with perfect accuracy. It is a consequence of the dual nature of matter. According to Heisenberg uncertainty; It is impossible to accurately find both, the position and momentum of an object simultaneously. According to this principle; The product of uncertainties in determining the position and momentum of a particle at the same instant is approximately equal to fh (read as \u2018h-cut\u2019); whereas fi = z =1.054x 10\" Js. \u20184 If position of a particle has an uncertainty Ax and that of the corresponding momentum is Ap, then uncertainties are found to be related in general by the inequality as: Ax.

In quantum mechanics a particle is described by a wave, the term position refers; point where the wave is concentrated. The uncertainty in position means; the position is uncertain to the degree that the wave is spread out. While the uncertainty in momentum means; the momentum is uncertain to the degree that the wavelength is unclear. These uncertainties are inherent in the physical world and have nothing to do with the skill of observer; due to the very small value of angular Planck\u2019s constant, these Uncertgpries are not observable in normal everyday situations.

SUMMARY \u201c@ When electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by a material, electronically-charged particles are released from the material (or even within itself). This phenomenon is called the photoelectric effect. * Conservation of momentum implies that if two or more bodies interact with each other in an isolated system\u2122(that\u00bbis, no external force is acting up6n them), then the total momentum of all the bodies remains constant. The electrons which are emitted from a metal surface upon the influence of light are called photoelectrons. Threshold energy is the minimum amount of energy needed by the electron to break free from the metal and eject from it. Threshold frequency is the lowest frequency of electromagnetic radiation that will produce _ a photoelectric effect in a material. The threshold wavelength is the largest possible wavelength of the incident radiation which allows photoemission to take place.

For example, the fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium releases a large amount of energy, as the product nucleus has a higher binding energy per nucleon than the reactant nuclei. 22.3 RADIOACTIVITY Marie Curie studied radioactivity (nuclear radiations emission) shortly after Henri Becquerel discovered natural radioactivity. Marie Curie detected radioactivity in Uranium and Thorium using an electrometer, which showed that the air around radioactive samples became charged and conductive. The natural emission of radiations from unstable nuclei is called radioactivity. Radioactivity is the phenomenon by which unstable atomic nuclei spontaneously decay into other nuclei, emitting radiation in the process. Spontaneous nuclear decay is the natural process by which an unstable atomic nucleus breaks down into a more stable configuration by emitting radiation. This process is spontaneous and occurs without any external influence or trigger. Radioactive decay can also result in the formation of a new element known as the daughter nuclei. Spontaneous nuclear decay is a natural process that occurs in many elements in the universe. While it can poseva significant health hazards if not properly managed, it also has many practical applications in fields such as energy production, medicine and materials sciences. There are three main types of radioactive decay alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma decay, along with these radiations some more radiations and particles are also produced like X-rays and neutrons etc. pati 22.3.1 Alpha Decay \u00a5\u00a9 partie \u2019 Alpha decay occurs when an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons.

    "text": "angular momentum must be obeyed during the transition. Even though no particles with mass are emitted during gamma decay, the emission of gamma radiation can result in the change in energy of the nucleus. For example, if a nucleus a gamma ray after undergoing alpha or beta decay it may end up in a different energy state. In such cases the nucleus may still be unstable and may continue to undergo further radioactive decay until it reaches a stable state. These laws imply that : even though no particles with mass are emitted, the composition of the nucleus is certainly changed after emitting photons given by gamma decay.

It may decay just on the moment you started observing it or it may not decay even for years. The decay is a natural process inherent to the unstable nucleus itself. It happens because the nucleus is seeking a more stable state. This randomness is reflected in the fluctuations observed in the count rate of radioactive emission.

    "text": "~ in a) Ree WM \u201cd ia.. deacattio The number of decays detected per unit time is called as count rate. \u2019 When measuring the count rate using a Geiger-Muller counter or any other counters it can be noted that the count rate varies over time even if the conditions remain constant. These fluctuations occur because each decay event is spontaneous, independent, random and unpredictable. Each radioactive nucleus has a certain probability of decaying at any given moment but we cannot predict the exact time of decaying for any single nuclei, this property is known as \u201cspontaneity\u201d. Although the individual decay events are random the average behavior of a large number of nuclei follows a predictable pattern described by the half-life of the substance. This is the reason that the count rate over longer periods becomes more stable and predictable in spite of showing fluctuations over short interval decays. These evidences provide clear evidence that decay events are not influenced by external factors and occur spontaneously. Spontaneous nuclear decay is a natural process that occurs in many elements in the universe. While it can pose a significant health hazard if not properly managed, it also has numerous practical applications in fields such as energy production, medicine, and materials science. Example 22.4.

A nuclear reaction is said to occur when an incident nucleus, particle or photon causes a change in the target nucleus. Nuclear reactions are processes in which atomic nuclei interact, resulting in changes to the nucleus, such as fusion, fission, or radioactive decay, often releasing or absorbing energy. A nuclear reaction changes the identity or characteristics of an atomic nucleus by bombarding it with an energetic particle. The bombarding particle may be an alpha particle, a gamma ray photon, a neutron, a proton or a heavy ion. These bombarding particles must have enough energy to approach the positively charged nucleus within the range of the strong nuclear force. Let the nucleus \u2018X\u2019 is bombarded by some light particle \u2018a\u2019 which products a nucleus \u2018Y\u2019 along with a light particle \u2018b\u2019 mathematically: a+X\u2014>Y+b The first ever nuclear transmutation, as shown in Fig. 22.10, observed by Rutherford, is given below: sSHe + \"N > \"0 + IH +Q \u2018'H Figure 22.10: Nuclear reaction. Where Q is the energy released or absorbed equivalent to the difference of the rest masses of the elements on both sides of nuclear reaction.

The process is typically initiated by bombarding the nucleus with a neutron, which causes it to become unstable and split apart.

To sustain the fission process, we need one neutron per fission to be capable of carrying out next fission. If the size of material is large, some of these neutrons may be captured to produce further fission. Hence, we need a minimum mass of material to sustain fission chain reaction which is called as critical mass and can be defined as: The minimum mass of the material to sustain the fission chain reaction is known as the critical mass. If the mass of the material is less than the critical mass the fission process would soon come to an end.

Energy in Fission Reaction: A huge amount of energy is released in nuclear reactions, particularly in nuclear fission reaction, which is much greater than the amount of energy released in a typical chemical reaction. For example, a single fission event like the splitting of uranium-235 nucleus releases about 200 MeV of energy. On the other hand, a chemical reaction like combustion of fossil fuels release energy on the order of a few electron volts (eV) per reaction. For example, energy released by one molecule of methane (CH,) gas is about 9.2 eV. The fission of 1 kg of uranium-235 can produce about 2.5 million times more energy than burning of 1 kg of coal. Hence, nuclear fission reaction releases energy that is millions of times greater than that of chemical reactions. Due to this huge energy difference nuclear power plants are so useful as compared to traditional chemical based energy sources. Example 22.7.

Control Rods: Control rods also called as safety rods play very important role in the action of nuclear reactor as they are used to control the extent of reaction and do not allow the fuel to react at once. They are made of a material such as boron or cadmium that absorbs neutrons. These rods cofttrol the fission reaction by absorbing some of the neutrons and preventing them from causing additional fission reactions as for the output of a reactor to be constant only one neutron from each event should process further fission reaction. These rods can move into or out of the reactor\u2019s core as per need. Moderator: Material that slows down the neutrons is called moderator. Neutrons with energies of about 0.025 eV are used in fission of uranium while the neutrons emitting from fission reaction are fast and have energies in the range of MeV which is not required for fission. The commonly used materials used as moderator are water and graphite that slows down the neutrons produced by fission as slowing down the neutrons make them more likely to cause additional fission.

Enrichment of Uranium The uranium found in nature has different isotopes and each isotope has different properties and characteristics. Every isotope of uranium is not equally favorable for the nuclear fission chain reaction. Uranium usually has two main isotopes i.e., Uranium-235 and Uranium-238. About 99.3% of natural uranium is U-238 but unluckily it is not directly fissile but it can capture neutrons and can be converted into plutonium-239 (Pu-239) which is fissile. On the other hand, uranium-235 is about 0.7% of natural uranium and this isotope is fissile means it can sustain a chain reaction by absorbing neutrons and undergoes fission. Hence uranium fuel needs to be enriched because natural uranium contains too low concentration of fissile U-235. Enrichment increases the proportion of U-235 allowing reactors to achieve and maintain criticality, operate efficiently, manage reactor design and fuel usage effectively. The process of converting non fissile material like uranium-238 into a fissile material like uranium-235 is called enrichment. To sustain a controlled nuclear chain reaction a reactor needs a sufficient concentration of fissile material i.e. U-235 in nature its concentration is as low as 0.7% which is not sufficient and nuclear reactor cannot be run on this percentage. Enriched uranium typically contains 3- 5% U-235 due to this higher concentration of U-235 it improves the efficiency of reactor making it more feasible to maintain a steady and controlled reaction. Various methods can be used to enrich uranium including gaseous diffusion method, as shown in Fig. 22.18, gas centrifugation and laser enrichment. The most common method is gas centrifugation which uses rapidly spinning centrifuges to separate uranium isotopes based on difference in their masses. Natural Uranium Enriched Uranium 0.711% U-235"

It occurs when a particle collides with its corresponding anti-particle resulting their mutual destruction and conversion of their mass into energy. This process is governed by the principles of conservation of momentum and mass- energy means total energy before and after the annihilation remains the same, as described by Einstein\u2019s equation E =m c?. The total momentum also conserves in these reactions i.e. the total momentum of photons will be equal to the initial momentum of the particle and anti- particle. The most common example of annihilation reaction is electron-positron annihilation to produce two gamma ray photons and can be given as: e+e'=Y+y (22.2) Another annihilation reaction can be of proton and anti-proton in which they annihilate to produce photons or various other particles like pion and kaon, such reactions can be given as: Pp\u2019 +p =y+y , 0 4 or p'+p =x +n +7\u00b0 \u201c+ = - @@+0-0+6-1 The annihilation reaction of proton and 14. proton Energy yt ne r anti-proton is shown in Fig. 22.28. proton The energy in electron-positron Figure 22.19: Proton anti-proton annihilation, annihilation given by equation (22.2) can be calculated as: The rest mass energy of an electron can be found by using equation E=m,c* while the rest mass of an electron and positron is 9.1107\u2019 kg .

Electromagnetic radiations also give us information of far-off outer space or universe.

The human eye can only detect a small portion of this spectrum, called visible light. NASA's scientific instruments use the full range of the electromagnetic spectrum to study the Earth, the solar system, and the universe beyond.

Radiant Flux Intensity Light sources (such as stars) that are further away from the Earth appear fainter because the light they emit is spread out over a larger area. The moment the light leaves the surface of the star, it begins to spread out uniformly through a spherical shell (with an area of 4mr\u2019). The radius r of this sphere is equal to the distance d between the star and the Earth. By the time the radiation reaches the Earth, it has been spread over an area of 4nd\u2019.

All of the techniques used by astronomers involve analysing the light emitted from the star, or galaxy. One of these techniques involves analysing the emission and absorption spectra of stars. Elements in the star (mostly hydrogen and helium) absorb some of the emitted wavelengths. Therefore, characteristic lines are present when the spectrum is analysed. Every element has a unique set of absorption and emission lines. The pattern of lines is known as a spectral signature. The absorption and emission spectra of each element are inverses of each other: The wavelengths of a particular*element\u2019s absorption lines are the same as the wavelengths of its emission lines. Astronomers can compare the spectrum of a celestial object or material with the spectra of known elements and molecules to figure out what the object or material is made of. Absorption Spectra: When light passes through a gas, atoms and molecules in the gas absorb certain colors, or wavelengths, of that light. The result is an absorption spectrum: a rainbow with dark absorption lines. Emission Spectra: The same gas can glow, giving off very specific colors to form an emission spectrum with bright lines known as emission lines: Spectra of Light from Stars and Galaxies When astronomers observe light from distant galaxies, they observe differences in the spectral lines to the light from the Sun.

Therefore, the age of the universe T, is equal to: Figure 23.7: Tracing the expansion of the universe back to the beginning of time leads to the idea the = 7\u2014 (23.6) universe began with a Big-Bang. \u00b0 Presently estimated age of the universe ranges from 13 to 14 billion years.

One of the key ingredients of this system is the radiant energy received from the Sun. This solar energy powers Earth\u2019s atmospheric circulations, ocean currents and the hydrological cycle shaping the distribution of heat and moisture across the planet.

These gases allow visible light from the Sun to penetrate to the surface but block some of infrared radiations emitted by the Earth\u2019s surface which traps heat within the atmosphere contributing to the overall warming effect. The atmosphere is divided into different layers depending upon their altitude and functioning, as shown in Fig. 24.2. e Troposphere: The lowest layer extending from the ground (the surface of the Earth) to about 16 km.

In the northern hemisphere predictable winds called trade winds blow from east to west just above the equator. These winds pull surface water and the Coriolis effect deflects the currents. Then they bend to the right heading north.

Similar patterns.occur in the southern hemisphere but currents in this side are counter-clock wise i.e. bend to the left, as shown in Fig. 24.7. 2) Deep Ocean Currents The ocean currents beyond the depth of 500 meters are known as deep ocean currents. These currents are formed due to the differences in temperature and density of the water in different parts of the ocean. Some of them are explained below. e Warm Water Northward: The surface currents carry warm water north from the equator as this water moves into higher northern latitudes it cools down e Density: The density of sea water plays a major role in producing ocean currents and circulating heat as cooling process increases \u2018he water\u2019s denstv.

Earth\u2019s Angular Momentum and Wind Patterns The conservation of angular momentum plays a crucial role in determining the wind patterns on the Earth.

The Coriolis effect causes winds to be deflected more strongly at the higher latitudes closer to the poles. It is important to note that the magnitude of wind speed is not directly influenced by the Coriolis force but the direction of the wind will change significantly as we move from equator towards the pole. As from the equator where the distance of the surface of Earth from the axis of rotation is large i.e., it has large moment of inertia at this point, here the speeds of winds will be low but near poles the moment of inertia becomes small and hence increases the speed of winds. This difference in the speed of winds accounts for the weather patterns on Earth.

The geostrophic wind blows parallel to isobars and is influenced by two main forces as: e Horizontal pressure gradient force (the change in pressure measured across a given distance is called a pressure gradient) derives the air movement from higher to lower pressure areas. e Coriolis force results from the Earth\u2019s rotation and causes the deflection of wind to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. Wind speed increases as the distance between isobars decreases or pressure gradient increases. The impact of wind on climate can be given as: e Heat Transport: Wind carries heat from one region to another. For example, ocean currents driven by wind transport warm water from the equator towards the poles. e Moisture Transport: Wind transports moisture affecting precipitation patterns (precipitation is any liquid or frozen water that forms in the atmosphere and falls back to the Earth). Trade winds, westerlies and polar easterlies play essential roles in distributing moisture globally. These winds on globe are shown in Fig. 24.10. e Pollutant Dispersion: wind disperses pollutants like dust, smoke and industrial emissions across the large area. e Pollen Distribution: Wind help disperse pollen helping plant reproduction. e Daily weather Patterns: Coastal regions experience daily changes in wind direction due to differential heating of land and water (the difference in how land and water aateces absorb heat is called as differential heating).

This phenomenon occurs due to various complex feedback mechanisms and processes within the Earth\u2019s climate system. These feedback mechanisms include: e Positive feedback: Some feedbacks amplify initial changes for example as the arctic ice melts due to warming it reduces the Earth\u2019s reflectivity leading to further warming. \u00a2 Negative feedback: Other feedbacks dampen changes for example increased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels stimulate plant growth which absorbs some carbon acting as negative feedback. The climate inertia is time dependent as for example if greenhouse gas emissions were to stabilize immediately the Earth\u2019s climate would continue to warm for some time due*to heat already stored in the oceans. Climate processes operate on various timescales from days to centuries like: e Short-term Inertia: The ocean and land surfaces absorb and release heat relatively slowly leading to short term inertia this is why daily temperature fluctuations occur e Long-term Inertia: changes in greenhouse gas concentrations like carbon dioxide take decades to centuries to fully impact the climate system. When we stabilize greenhouse gas emission the climate system does not respond immediately. Oceans play a main role in climate inertia as they have high heat capacity means they absorb and release heat slowly. Changes in ocean temperature occur gradually affecting climate patterns over extended periods.

It is simple the balance between the incoming solar radiation (insolation) and outgoing terrestrial radiations. The Earth\u2019s energy budget can have the components like: e Incoming Solar radiations: The Sun emits energy in the form of sunlight. Approximately 49% \u2019 of this solar energy is absorbed by the Earth\u2019s surface primarily by land, ocean and vegetation, e Atmospheric Absorption: About 20% of solar radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere itself. e Outgoing Terrestrial Radiations: The Earth which absorbs radiation can also re-emit these radiations as heat. This process occurs through infrared radiations emitted by the surface and the atmosphere. The greenhouse effect also plays a role in the energy distribution in the Earth\u2019s climate in regulating the globe\u2019s temperature. It involves\u2019 the interaction of solar radiation with greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It can be explained in terms of steps like in first step sunlight penetrates the atmosphere and warms the Earth\u2019s surface. In second step the heated surface of the Earth emits infrared radiations. In third step greenhouse gases absorb some of these outgoing radiations preventing them from escaping directly into the space. Instead, they re-radiate part of this energy back towards the surface effectively trapping heat. Without the greenhouse effect Earth\u2019s average temperature would be well below freezing. 24.4.1 Solar Variability and Climate While the Sun is essential for maintaining Earth\u2019s habitable conditions, its influence on climate change is relatively small compared to other factors.

These cycles affect solar radiation, sunspots and solar flares. e Long-term Trends: Over the past 40-years satellites have observed the Sun\u2019s energy output. However, changes in solar activity account for less than 0.1% of the warming observed since 1750. * Human Induced Warming: Human activities particularly the burning of fossil fuels release greenhouse gases. The warming caused by these gases is over 270 times greater than any sunlight warming from the Sun itself during the same period. 24.4.2 Energy Imbalance The uneven distribution of solar energy across the Earth\u2019s surface creates an energy imbalance. The energy imbalance on the Earth is the main cause of the atmospheric circulations. For example, equator receives more solar energy due to direct sunlight while the pole regions receive less solar energy due to oblique sunlight, as shown in Fig, 24,13, This energy imbalance drives the atmospheric circulations as: National Book Foundation (496) 24-Earth\u2019s Climate"

Climate being a complex and interconnected system can exhibit chaotic behavior as we often think of climate as having predictable seasons and weather patterns (like the news inform us about a rain today but it does not happen) it can also undergo sudden and rapid changes due to chaotic dynamics.

Medical imaging seeks to reveal internal structures hidden by the skin and bones, as well as to diagnose and treat disease. Medical imaging also creates a database of normal anatomy and physiology to make it possible to identify abnormalities. There are many different types of imaging techniques used in modern medicine, such as ultrasound, X-rays, CT (computed tomography) scans, and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Each imaging type uses a different technology to create an image. In this unit, we'll discuss some of the imaging techniques in detail. 25.1 PIEZOELECTRIC EFFECT AND ULTRASONIC WAVES Piezoelectric effect is the ability of certain materials to generate an electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress. When piezoelectric. material is placed under mechanical stress, a shifting of the positive and negative charges in the material takes place, which then results in an external electric field, as . shown in Fig. 25.1 (a). The piezoelectric effect is reversible, as shown in Fig. 25.1 (b), it means that: Figure 25.1 (a): Piezoelectric effect. The material can also generate stress when an electric field is applied.

    "text": "Generation of ultrasound uses reverse piezoelectric effect. In ultrasound equipment, a _ piezoelectric transducer converts electrical energy into extremely rapid vibrations. These vibrations are so fast that it makes sounds of too high- pitched for our ears to hear. When ultrasound waves hit an object and bounce back, creating an echo. After reflection or scattering, ultrasonic waves return to the detector causing the piezoelectric materials to vibrate, which generate an electric signal to be detected. In medical ultrasound, the detected signal determines the shape, size, and consistency of the object, generating a real-time image that appears on a screen. An ultrasound image of the pancreas is shown in Fig. 25.1 (c). Applications of Ultrasound in Medical Medical technology uses ultrasound for many purposes. Ultrasound is used to generate images of tissue and organs; this technique is known as sonography or echography. The great advantage of sonography over other imaging methods in medical technology is that sound waves are comparatively less harmful and can even be used for unborn babies. The ability to focus very intense ultrasonic waves in a small region without disturbing the surrounding tissues provides a very effective tool in neurosurgery. Special types of ultrasonic equipment are in use for the treatment of arthritics, muscular, rheumatism and sciatica. An important industrial application is the ultrasonic flow meter. Ultrasonic flow meters measure the flow rate of a liquid by transmitting high-frequency sound waves into the flowing liquid. The waves reflect off particles or bubbles in the liquid, experiencing a frequency shift due to the liquid\u2019s flow velocity, known as the Doppler shift. This shift is measured and used to calculate the flow rate. The meters typically consist of transducers installed on the pipe, which transmit and receive the ultrasound signals.

When a high energy electron travels towards a target nucleus in the X-rays tube, it has coulomb interaction with orbital electrons as well as the positive nucleus. The interaction with the nucleus is very strong due of the presence of concentrated positive charge in the nucleus. The force of attraction due to the large concentrated positive charge in the nucleus accelerates the electron, as shown in Fig. 25.2 (b). The electron begins to decelerate as it moves away from the nucleus. The decelerated electron emits radiation called Bremsstrahlung (a Germen word meaning braking radiation). This Bremsstrahlung is called continues X-rays. Energy of the electron decreases due to the emission of these radiations.

A high melting-point metal like platinum or tungsten is embedded at end of the copper rod and it serve as a target. The cathode and anode are enclosed inside an evacuated glass chamber. A high DC voltage of the order of 50,000 V is maintained between cathode and anode. The electrons emitted from the cathode are accelerated by the high potential difference. The energetic electrons strike the target and X-rays are produced. When such highly energetic electrons are suddenly stopped by target, an intense beam of X-rays is produced. A small part of the kinetic energy of the incident electrons is converted into X-rays, the rest is converted into heat. The target becomes very hot; therefore, it must have a high melting point. The heat generated in target is dissipated through the copper rod. Sometime the anode is cooled by water flowing behind the anode. Applications of X-Rays in Imaging Internal Body Structures X-ray imaging/photography is the most common and oldest diagnostic imaging technique. During an X-ray test, X-rays are allowed to pass through the body and are absorbed in different quantities by different organs. For example, the calcium content. in bones means that they absorb x-rays better than. other tissue, such as fat. An X-ray detector receives the X-rays after they pass through the body, generating an image that appears in shades of gray.

For example; Jorge Luis Borges, who is inspired by mathematical reasons in several of his works, like the \u201cAn Aleph is a point in space that encompasses all other points, offering a unified perspective where every location on Earth can be seen simultaneously from all angles, without spatial confusion or limitation\u201d. The Magic of Mathematics cna ia ai The majority of people may associate mathematics with intricate equations, chalkboards cavered with numbers, and sometimes even recollections of past tests. Mathematics is a universal language that bridges the vast scales of the universe, describing the intricate patterns of a seashell and the majestic spirals of distant galaxies with equal precision and beauty.

Numbers are not the only thing in mathematics. It is the fundamental component of invention as well as the language of the cosmos and the beat of nature.

Similarly universal equation is very much similar to flower where different parameters, numbers play role like petals, colour and even perfume to design equation, for example: The Euler\u2019s Equation; e\u2122+1=0 Euler\u2019s identity shows that geometry, calculus, and complex numbers are intimately related. Everybody knows the value of m, which represents the ratio of a circle's diameter to its circumference. Scholars have researched this universal mathematical constant for millennia. It is fundamental to geometry and can be found everywhere. Another number that is at least as significant as m is e, which is approximately 2.718281.

They are also derived from quite distinct areas of mathematics. Complex numbers, geometry, and calculus are closely connected, as demonstrated by Euler's identity. After all, they may be explained in terms of one another, therefore they are not really. distinct domains. Complex numbers can be thought of as the link between circular motion and arithmetic: The arithmetic of complex numbers provides information on angles, rotations, cycles, and periods, whereas the arithmetic of real numbers informs us about quantities.

While there are many advantages to this, according to Ivan Loseu, a mathematics associate professor at Northeastern University; it also makes for a challenging math problem. He claimed that minimizing the number of variables at play is the best route to a\u2019solution. imagine that the Earth is rotating around the sun. Given that the motion takes place in three dimensions, the Earth's position can only be described by three variables. Given that the Earth never deviates from a specific plane, Newtonian physics allows. us to further decrease the number of variables to only two. One variable is actually preferable to two, though. This is the reason why physicists track the Earth's elliptical journey using the characteristics of gravitational force. According to Loseu, The formula for gravity depends Sry on the distance between the sun and Earth. You can change the image, but the physical law doesn't change. He said that symmetry isthe single most important factor explaining why this problem can be resolved with just one variable. According to Loseu, symmetry is any transformation that keeps your issue intact. What Scientists say about Mathematics? Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas.

Yes, the term \u201cgravitas,\u201d which simply means \u201chaving weight\u201d or gravity, was applied to this unexplained effect. It was Newton who explained gravity, not who discovered it. Newton provided a clear mathematical law that could be tested to explain all of these occurrences and tie them together in a straightforward manner. The apple and the Moon are both connected to the Earth by gravity. The Moon moves sideways, which accounts for their different motion and the reason it doesn't land on Earth. There were following two curiosity points of Newton\u2019s research domain; 1. Why doesn't the Moon fall from the sky and land on Earth, given that all objects experience gravitational acceteration towards Earth? 2. Why.does the Moon move in a circle instead of a straight line, if, as Galileo said, objects move with constant speed and direction until acted upon by an external force?

By doing this, he strikes a balance between the cannonball\u2019s inertia, which causes it to desire to keep going in a straight path and away from the Earth, and the acceleration brought on by the Earth's gravity, which causes the cannonball to move towards the Earth's centre. As a result, the projectile orbits the planet, never getting any closer to it yet constantly increasing in speed, though acceleration is the change in velocity i.e., the change in both the speed and direction of an object. The projectile in this instance accelerates even if its speed is constant since its direction is changing. Newton discovered that the acceleration caused by Earth's gravity (a) and the orbit's radius (r), which is measured from the orbit's centre (i.e., the Earth's centre), were connected to the cannonball's speed in the following ways: Centripetal acceleration = a = v*/r Newton discovered it for a cannonball orbiting the Earth, but it holds true for any circularly moving object as well. Because of inertia, objects always prefer to move in straight lines; some sort of acceleration is required to cause them to bend into circular motion.

    "text": "PHYSICAL QUANTITIES AND MEASUREMENTS \" >. roe! NG Physics is based on experimental observations. Observations may be qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative observations have no associated numbers. This deal with facts that can be observed with our five senses: sight, smell, taste, touch and hearing. Colors, shapes and textures of objects are examples of qualitative observations. Observations, like \u2018water keeps its level\u2019, is also an example of qualitative observation. A quantitative observation includes numbers, and is also called a measurement. We can measure mass, time, distance, speed, pressure, force, torque, momentum, and energy. Quantitative observations are useful to a scientist. 1.1 ESTIMATION OF PHYSICAL QUANTITIES In our daily life, we may face some situations like: What will be the height of this building? Will the piece of equipment fit in the back of our car, or do we need to rent a truck? How long will this download take? How large a current will be there in this circuit? How many houses could a proposed power plant actually power if it is built? Usually, we solve such problems by making estimations. In many circumstances, scientists and engineers also need to make estimates of some specific physical quantity with the help of little or no actual data. An estimation is a rough educated guess of the value of a physical quantity by using prio experience and sound physical reasoning. An estimation usually includes the identification of correct physical principles and a good guess about the relevant variables. Estimation is very useful in developing a physical sense. Estimation does not mean guessing a formula or a number at random. Some of the following strategies may help to improve our skill of estimation: Estimation of length: When estimating lengths, remember that anything can be a ruler. For breaking a big thing into smaller things,"

Some of the following strategies may help to improve our skill of estimation: Estimation of length: When estimating lengths, remember that anything can be a ruler. For breaking a big thing into smaller things, first estimate the length of one of the smaller things and then multiply this value to the number of smaller things to obtain the length of the big thing. For example, to estimate the height of building, we first count the number of floors it has. Then, estimate the height of a single floor by imagining how many people would have to stand on each other's shoulders to reach the ceiling. In the last, we estimate the height of a person. These estimates give you the height of the building. Sometimes it also helps to do this in reverse, i.e., to estimate the length of a small thing which in bulk making up a bigger thing. For example, to estimate the thickness of a sheet of paper, estimate the thickness of a stack of paper and then divide it by the number of pages in the stack. These same strategies of breaking big things into smaller things or aggregating smaller things into a bigger thing can sometimes be used to estimate other physical quantities, such as mass and time. In such situations, some of the length, mass and time scales, as shown in Table 1.1 may be helpful.

For this estimation, it helps to remember that the density of air is about 1 kgm, the density of water is 10\u00b0 kg m\u201d\u2019, and the densest everyday solids has a maximum value around 10\u2018 kg m?.

Some examples of dimensionless variables are plane angle, solid angle, strain and coefficient of friction etc. Dimensionless Constants: Those physical quantities that have no dimensions and have constant magnitude are called dimensionless constants. The pure numbers (1, 2, 3, ....), the exponential constant (e = 2.718) and nm are some examples of dimensionless constants. 1.3.1Advantages of Dimensions Using the method of dimensions (called dimensional analysis), we can check the homogeneity of an equation, derive a possible formula and determine units of physical quantities. Dimensional analysis makes use of the fact that dimensions can be treated as algebraic quantities. That is, quantities can be added or subtracted only if they have the same dimensions. Furthermore, the terms.on both sides of an equation must have the same dimensions. (i) The Homogeneity of an Equation In order to check the correctness of an equation, we must ensure that both sides of the equation have the same dimensions: otherwise, the equation cannot be considered as a physically correct equation.

    "text": "\u00a5 CeO\u2122, vectors { 6406): Se In our daily life, we used to deal with physical quantities, such as mass, time, length, velocity, acceleration, force, work and torque etc. Some physical quantities, known as scalars, can be completely understood by a number and a proper unit only. On the other hand, some physical quantities require direction along with a number and a unit; such quantities are known as vectors. Displacement, force, acceleration, torque and momentum etc., are the examples of vector quantities. Vectors are very useful in our daily life. For example, a signboard provides information about distances and directions of other places relative to the location of the signboard. Distance is a scalar quantity. Knowing the distance alone is not enough to get to the desired location. We must also know the direction from the signboard to the destination. The direction along with the distance, is a vector quantity called the displacement. Therefore, signboards give information about displacement from the signboard to the destination. Graphically, a vector can be completely expressed by a line with an arrow head. Length of the line represents the magnitude according to the proper scale and the arrow head represents the direction. We have studied about the addition of vectors in grade 9; here we shall study about the components of vectors and about the products of vectors. 2.1 VECTOR RESOLUTION Components are the effective parts of a vector in different directions. In 2-D, we take x- component and y-component. The component along x-axis is called the horizontal or the x- component and the component along the y-axis is called the vertical or the y-component.

The motion of a missile through the air can be described by its range, velocity, and acceleration. When it flies, a short patch of its path can be considered a straight line without any change in direction. However, its motion is not straight for long; instead, it is a 2-dimensional motion under the action of gravity, called projectile motion. Similarly, all the objects in this universe are in motion. Thus, understanding motion is also key to understanding other concepts in physics. For example, an understanding of velocity is crucial to the study of momentum. There are three types of motion: translational motion, rotational motion and vibrational motion. In this chapter, we will concern ourselves only with translational motion, such as motion along a straight line and projectile motion. We begin with kinematics which is the branch of mechanics that deals with the study of motion without considering the causes of motion. This includes the terms such as displacement, velocity and acceleration in straight line. Using these terms, we study the motion of objects undergoing constant acceleration. We begin with derivation of the equations of motion and then we use them to solve problems of uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line, including the motion of bodies falling in a uniform gravitational field without air resistance. It is also extended to objects moving along c ved paths, such as projectile motion under the action of gravity only and its applications. we deal with dynamics, which is the branch of mechanics which deals with the study of forces that cause the objects and systems to move.

This occurs during free-fall, when the force of gravity is balanced out by the inertial force from orbital flight, like centrifugal force. In a weightless environment, objects and individuals float freely, as there is no force pulling them towards the ground. This phenomenon is commonly experienced by astronauts in space, where they appear to be float inside their spacecraft with objects around them. The term zero gravity is often used incorrectly to describe weightlessness, as astronauts in space stations are not in gravity free environment high above the Earth, 250 miles out in space, where most space stations orbit, the gravitational field is still quite strong there roughly 95% of its at on surface of the Earth. Weightlessness can be achieved in two ways. One that to travel millions of miles from gravitational force of large object, where the gravitational force reduces to nearly zero. Or the second and much more practical is to create weightless environment through act of free fall. The space stations are in constant free fall, having the right speed and at right altitude.

SUMMARY * Angular velocity: The rate at which an object changes the angle while moving on a circular path. * Tangential acceleration: The acceleration in a direction tangent to the circle at the point of interest in circular motion. * Angular acceleration: The rate of change of angular velocity with respect to time. * Centripetal Bceenyapon: The acceleration of an object moving in a circle, directed toward the center. \u00ab Centripetal force: Any net force causing uniform circular motion. ** Moment of inertia: Mass times the square of perpendicular distance from the rotation axis; for a point mass, it is | = mr? and, because any object can be built up from a collection of point masses, this relationship is the basis for all other moments of inertia. * Torque: The turning effectiveness of a force and is defined as product of moment of inertia and angular acceleration (t= Ia). * Angular momentum: The product of moment of inertia and angular velocity (L = Iw). * Angular momentum is conserved, i.e., the initial angular momentum is equal to the final angular momentum when no external torque is applied to the system.

This action is an example of doing work by lifting and lowering a mass. Weightlifting requires energy from the body's metabolic processes, specifically from the breakdown of a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Additionally, weightlifting can also utilize stored glycogen in muscle tissue, which can be broken down into glucose to provide energy. 5.1 WORK The work done on an object is the scalar (or dot) iii of force F and ini d.

Work Done from Force-Displacement Graph: The area under the force-displacement graph gives the work done. A.

Work Done by Variable Force: In Fig. 5.4, graph with increasing force to produce net displacement is shown, here the blue shaded area of triangle represent work done by the increasing force. However, in many situations of daily life, the force is variable in many different ways, and therefore we get different graphs for area under the curve for work done by such forces. For example, when we stretch a spring, the more we stretch it, the harder we have to pull, so the force we exert is not constant as the spring is stretched.

Probably she relies on balance between resistive forces and her weight. A resistive force on a moving object opposes the motion of the object or prevent a stationary object from moving, for example friction, viscous force etc. When forces are acting on an object, energy transformations occur, which means the work is being done. The work done \u2018W\u2019 on an object by an applied force \u2018F\u2019 is the sum of the gain in kinetic energy \u2018AK.E\u2019 of the object and the work done by the object against the resistive force \u2018W,\u2019.

An important fluid, blood is flowing in our body\u2019s veins, flow of which is essential for life. Life would not exist without fluids and without the behavior that fluids exhibit. Why does rising smoke curl and twist? How does a nozzle increase the speed of water emerging from a hose? How does an airplane gain lift while accelerating on the runway? Fluid mechanics allows us to answer these and many other questions. In Grade-IX, we have dealt with many situations in which fluids are static. In this chapter, we will deal mainly with the flow of fluid. Fluid mechanics is the branch of physics in which we study about the fluid, either static or dynamic. Studying the fluid in motion is called fluid dynamics. The study of fluids in motion is relatively complex, but analysis can be simplified by making few assumptions such as fluid under consideration is non-viscous, incompressible and its motion is steady. The analysis is further simplified by the use of two important conservation principles, the conservation of mass and conservation of energy. The law of conservation of mass gives us the equation of continuity, while the law of conservation of energy forms the basis of Bernoulli\u2019s equation. The equation of continuity and the Bernoulli\u2019s equation along with their numerous applications in everyday life, including sports, transportation and technology are discussed in this unit. 6.1 UPTHRUST AND ARCHIMEDES PRINCIPLE Have you ever thought that: Why do heavy ships float on water surface?

Drag Force: A drag force acts on a solid object when it is moving in a fluid (either a gas or a liquid). You feel the drag force when you move your hand through water. If you stretch out your hand out of the window of a fast-moving car, you can easily recognize that considerable drag force has to be exerted on your hand as it moves through the air. You feel a smaller drag force when you tilt your hand. The drag force become larger as the speed of the car increases.

The streamlines (paths of different particles) do not cross each other and every fluid particle arriving at a given point has the same velocity. It usually occurs at lower velocities and with streamlined objects. In laminar flow, the middle layer of fluid tends to flow faster. Above a certain critical speed, streamline flow becomes turbulent. Turbulent flow is Pisigute flow characterized by small whirlpool-like regions as shown in Fig. 6.6 (b).

When you squeeze the rubber bulb (Fig. 6.10), high speed air passes horizontally over a vertical tube and creating a lower pressure than that inside the container. This pressure difference pushes the liquid from the reservoir up through the vertical narrow tube and into the moving stream of air. Atomizer has a nozzle at the end of the horizontal tube, which causes the liquid to break up into small drops, mixing it with the air and carried away with the stream of air.

The liquid having high pressure and low velocity gets converted to the low pressure and high velocity at a particular point and again reaches to high pressure and low velocity. The point where the fluid has low pressure and high velocity is the place where the venturi flow meter is used. Figure 6.13: Venturi meter. The venturi meter is constructed, as shown in Fig. 6.13. Venturi meter is so designed as to ensure the stream line flow of liquid through a pipe section with area Ai, a flow velocity v; and pressure P;. In the narrow section (the throat) with area Az, the fluid flows with flow speed v2, and has pressure P2. As a result, the pressure difference at two points 1 and 2 is appeared as a height difference h. To derive an expression for the pressure difference, we use the Bernoulli\u2019s equation and the continuity equation.

    "text": "A FLUID MECHANICS. sg a od Fluid Mechanics and Medical Technology Medical technology uses heartbeat and sound of blood flow to find the blood pressure. A fluid exerts pressure on the walls of its container. As a fluid, blood also exerts pressure on the walls of the heart, arteries, vessels, and capillaries that make up the circulatory system. The sphygmomanometer is a well- known medical equipment used for the measurement of blood pressure of a person. The sphygmomanometer cuff (air bag) is placed around the upper arm of a person, inflated, and then deflated while the meter measures the pressure of blood passing through those arteries in the arm. The external pressure is increased by pressing the air bulb repeatedly. The sound of the blood flow is heard by the stethoscope. The gradual increase in pressure squeezes the arm and compresses the blood vessels under the air bag. When the pressure in the air bag becomes greater than the systolic pressure (120 torr), then the vessels collapse, cutting off the flow of blood. At this instant _ stethoscope detect no sound. The pressure in the bag is then decreased by slowly opening the release valve of air bulb. When the external pressure becomes equal to systolic pressure, the blood flows (turbulent) with high speed through narrow contracted vessel. Stethoscope detects sound at this instant and dial of the barometer gives systolic pressure. By further opening the release valve, the pressure in the air bag drops enough that the vessels no longer remain compressed and the blood is now in laminar flow.

SUMMARY \"On @ Archimedes principle states that: When an object is totally or partially immersed in a liquid, an up-thrust acts on it equal to the weight of the liquid it displaces. \u00a9 The resistance offered by different layers of a fluid to its flow is called viscosity. Its unit is Ns m* or kg m's\u2018 or Pas. * The retarding force (resistance) experienced by an object moving through a fluid is called drag force or viscous drag. < The maximum constant velocity acquired by a freely falling object in a viscous medium is called terminal velocity. If every particle that passes a particular point moves along exactly the same smooth path followed by previous particle passing that has passed that point, then such flow is called Streamline. * Irregular flow of fluid is called turbulent flow. * Equation of continuity is defined as: For an ideal fluid the product of cross-sectional area of the pipe and the fluid speed at any point along the pipe is always constant. This product is equal to the volume flow per second or simply the flow rate. * Bernoulli\u2019s equation states that sum of the pressure, the potential energy per unit volume and the kinetic energy per unit volume will remain constant. According to Bernoulli\u2019s equation slow air flow creates a high pressure, while fast air flow creates low pressure. 107"

Materials have specific uses depending upon their properties and characteristics, such as hardness, ductility, brittleness, malleability and response to the applied pressure. What makes steel hard and lead soft? It depends on the structure, the particular order and the bonding of atoms in a material. This clue has made it possible to design and create materials with unique properties for their use in the modern technology. 7.1 CLASSIFICATION OF SOLIDS Solids are the materials which are incompressible and have a fixed shape and volume. On the basis of atomic arrangement (the structure), solids may be classified into three types: crystalline, polycrystalline (polymeric) and amorphous (glassy) solids. 7.1.1 Crystalline Solids In solids, particles are closely packed together but their packing may have s ga\u201d different patterns. The arrangement \u00a5 of particles can be studied by X-rays A, A re oo diffraction technique.

Examples of crystalline solids include salts (sodium chloride, and potassium chloride), metals (copper, iron and zinc), non-metals (diamond, sulphar and mica), ionic compounds (NaCl and copper sulphate), ceramic (zirconium), sand and quartz. Crystalline solids have sharp melting points. Crystalline solids are anisotropic for their physical property measurement. On cutting, they give sharp cleaves. 7.1.2 Polycrystalline Solids The solids having structure in between order and disorder, are called polycrystalline or polymeric solids. Hence, these are partially or poorly crystalline. A solid material made up of many small crystals with random a orientation, is called polycrystalline solid.

Teflon coating is used in high efficiency engines to reduce the friction, as it has good efficiency even at higher temperatures.

Open system: A system in which both heat energy and mass can enter or leave it, is called open system. An example of open system is a glass beaker with an open top which allows matter (i.e., water) to be added or removed, as well as, heat to be added or removed.

An ideal gas is one in which all collisions between atoms or molecules are perfectly elastic and there are no intermolecular attractive forces between them. The internal energy of an ideal gas system is generally the translational K.E of its molecules. Molecules of a gas are always in random motion. According to the kinetic theory of gases, the average kinetic energy of gas molecules is given by: Where k is Boltzmann\u2019s constant. If temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of gas molecules also increases. | Therefore, the internal energy increases with rise in | temperature. Since temperature is directly proportional to average kinetic energy of gas molecules, i.e. Tx<K.E>. Therefore, the internal energy of an ideal gas is directly proportional to its temperature. The internal Energy of a system can be increased by heating and doing mechanical work. When we heat a substance, energy associated with its atoms or molecules increases. i.e., heat is converted into internal energy. Similarly, when two objects are rubbed together, their internal energy increases due to the mechanical work. The increase in temperature of the object indicates an increase in its internal energy. Likewise, when an object slides over a surface and comes to rest due to frictional forces, the mechanical work done on or by the system is partially converted into internal energy.

According to the theory, a gas is composed of a number of tiny, hard spheres (molecules) that collide with one another and with the container walls. These molecules move in accordance with Newton's laws of motion. It explains how the motion of molecules influences the macroscopic properties of gases, such as temperature and pressure. It relates macroscopic properties (T, P, | \u201cO/=Slis and V etc.) of gases to microscopic properties (K.E etc.). Assumptions of Kinetic Theory of Gases: The following are the assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases: \u00a2 A finite volume of gas consists of a very large number of molecules. e The size of the molecules is much smaller-than the separation between them. e The gas molecules are in random motion and may change their direction of motion after every collision.

    "text": "\u201cive WAVES The Doppler\u2019s effect is of great interest to astronomers, who use shift in the frequency of electromagnetic waves produced by moving stars in our galaxy and beyond in order to gather information about those stars and galaxies. In 1929, Edwin Hubble observed that all galaxies appeared to be red-shifted (i.e. moving away from us and each other), leading him to propose that the universe is expanding. Specific information about stars within galaxies can be determined by using the Doppler\u2019s effect. HOST STAR appear to be shifted to lower in frequencies (a red shift) if the star is moving away from the Earth. On the other hand, there is an upward shift in frequency (a blue shift) of such observed radiation if the star is moving towards the Earth. Doppler effect is used to measure speed in RADAR sensors. This is known as radar speed traps. When a fixed-frequency radio wave sent by the sender continuously strikes an object | moving towards or away from the sender, the frequency of the reflected radio wave will be changed due to the object's motion. Thus, analyzing the frequency of the reflected wave one can find the speed of moving object. Doppler effect is used in the diagnosis of cardiac diseases.

If the two sound sources: the piano string and the tuning fork, produce detectable beats then their frequencies are not identical. They will then adjust the tension of the piano string and repeat the process until the beats can no longer be heard. As the piano string becomes more in tune with the tuning fork, the beat frequency will be reduced and approach 0 Hz. When beats are no longer heard, the piano string is tuned to the tuning fork; that is, they play the same frequency as the tuning fork.

They have a special ability to reduce the glare of light reflected from water or sky. A camera used to photograph the clouds is fitted with a polaroid before the camera lens. The light coming from sky is polarized by polaroid. Thus, the background becomes sufficiently dark against which a clear photograph is obtained. te \u2014 ee \u2014 nolo d Polaroids in Stress Analysis: In plastic industry, polaroid is used to perform stress analysis tests on transparent plastics. As light passes through a plastic, each color of visible light is polarized with its own direction. If such a plastic is placed between two polarizing plates, a colorful pattern is observed. As the top plate is turned, the color pattern changes as new colors become blocked and the formerly blocked colors are transmitted. Structural stress in plastic is signified at locations where there is a large concentration of colored bands. This location of stress is usually the location where structural failure will most probably occur. Polaroids are also used in the entertainment industry to display 3-D movies. Example 9.5: An Unpolarized light having intensity of = 16 W m7 is incident on a pair of polarizers. The first polaroid filter has its transmission axis at 50\u00b0 from the vertical, The second polaroid filter has its transmission axis at 20\u00b0 from the vertical."

Solution: First, we calculate the intensity of the light when it emerges from the first polarizer. As the light is unpolarized, so ly =lo/2=16/2=8Wm? Now we calculate the intensity of the light when it emerges from the second polaroid filter. As, when it emerges from the first polaroid filter the light is linearly polarized at 50\u00b0. The angle between this light and the transmission axis of the second polaroid filter is 50\u00b0- 20\u00b0= 30\u00b0 Therefore, ln = 1 cos? 30\u00b0 = 8 x (0.866)? = 8 x 0.75 =6 Wm? \u201c177 -"

Each proton has one unit of positive charge and each electron has one unit of negative charge. A neutron has no charge. Protons and neutrons are tightly packed in the nucleus while electrons can be thought of as small charged clouds that surround the nucleus of atoms. An atom normally has an equal number of electrons and protons making it electrically neutral. If an electron is removed from an atom, then the atom acquires a net positive charge. if an extra electron is added to an atom, it acquires a net negative charge. In the cover picture, it is shown that when we rub a comb in our hairs, the comb gets charged. When this charged comb is brought to the pieces of papers, these pieces get attracted due to induction. The study of electric charges at rest and the forces between them is referred to as electrostatics.

N m?C\u2122, This value of k is applicable if there is vacuum between the charges. Coulomb\u2019s law is applicable to point charges and uniform spherical charge distribution. A point charge is an imaginary charge located at a single point in space. An electron can be considered a point charge. A charged sphere also behaves as a point charge for a point outside the spherical conductor. This is due to the reason that the electric field at any point outside a spherical charge distribution is the same as the field that would be produced by a point charge located at its center. This is true only if the spherical conductor is isolated. If another charged object is brought near the spherical conductor, it will induce surface charges in the spherical conductor that are not spherically symmetric, and therefore, we can no longer treat it as a point charge.

Electric fields are found around electric charges and help determine the direction and magnitude of force the charge exerts on a nearby charged particle. The concept of a field was developed by Michael Faraday (1791-1867) in the context of electric forces. It is defined as: The region around a charge in which a test charge \u00a9 can feel an electric force is called electric field. _ An electric field is said to exist in the region of space around a charged object, the source charge. When another charged object called the test charge enters this electric field, an electric force acts on it. As an example, consider Fig. 10.4, which shows a small positive test charge q placed near a second object | carrying a much greater positive charge Q. The electric field vector E at a point in space is defined as"

Electric field intensity E is a single vector quantity containing information about the field strength and its direction at a point. The strength of the field at a point in space determines the amount of force that a charge will experience if it is placed at that point. The direction in which this unit positive test charge will move or tends to move is the direction of the electric field. The test charge is so small that it does not distort the original field due to the primary source. if F is the force experienced by a test charge q placed inside the field, then the value of electric intensity E at that\u2019 point is given as: If we use coulomb\u2019s law, F= K29p, then the above equation appears as: The SI unit of E is newton per coulomb (N C~') or volt per metre (V m\").

Figure 10.7 shows the symmetric electric field lines for two PHS | charges of equal magnitude but opposite sign. This charge configuration is called an electric dipole. Note that the field lines start from positive charge and ends at negative charge. The high density of lines between the charges indicates a strong electric field in this region.

Two negative charges also produce the fields very similar to the field produced by two positive charges, except that the directions are reversed. The electric lines of force between two oppositely charged parallel plates separated by a small distance is shown in Fig. 10.9.

A Faraday cage distributes charge or radiation around the cage\u2019s exterior, it cancels out electric charges or radiation within the cage. In short, a Faraday cage is a hollow conductor, in which the charge remains on the external surface of the cage. The fields within a conductor cancel out with any external fields, so the electric field within a conductor is zero. The Faraday cages act as big hollow conductors. We can put \u2018things into the Faraday cage to shield them from electrical fields. SUMMARY * Coulomb\u2019s law: The force of attraction or repulsion aki two aaaraen bodies is directly proportional to the product of the magnitude of charges and inversely icici to the square of distance between them. @ Coulomb\u2019s law is applicable to point charges and uniform spherical charge distribution. * The Superposition Principle of Force: When a number of separate charges act on the charge of interest, each exerts an electric force. These electric forces can all be computed separately, one at a time, then added as vectors. This is known as the superposition principle of force. * Electric Field: The region around a charge where a test charge experiences an electric force is called electric field.

This interaction of fields is the cause of force between them. Interaction of field lines can be drawn in the form of picture.

    "text": "ple . ELECTROMAGNETISM tN When the Earth vibrates due to earthquake, there is relative motion between magnet and the coil. This causes change in magnetic flux through the coil. It induces emf and current in the coil according to Faraday\u2019s law of electromagnetic induction. This induced current is given to external circuit where values are recorded and graph is plotted. During a high-intensity earthquake, the relative velocity between the coil and magnet increases, and the amplitude of the vibration of the coil increases. The induced emf in the coil is directly proportional to the displacement of the coil within the magnetic field. When the coil moves faster, the rate of change of displacement of the coil in a magnetic field increase; as a result, the rate of change of magnetic flux of the coil increases, and induced emf increases. SUMMARY... * The force on a charge moving inside a magnetic field result from interaction between the magnetic field produced by the moving charge (which is equivalent to current) and the applied magnetic field. * When a charge moves in magnetic field in circular path, its speed and K.E remain same but its velocity and momentum change due to change in direction of motion * For a point on the axis of a circular coil carrying current, magnetic field is maximum at the centre of the coil. * The magnetic field is the region or space surrounding a magnet in which a compass needle, a small magnet, another ferromagnetic material, and a moving charged particle experiences a magnetic force. * Magnetic flux linkage is defined as the product of the magnetic flux and the number of turns of the coil. * Faraday\u2019s law states that \u2018the magnitude of induced e.m.f. is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux"

Pap _.<e\u00ae Albert Einstein's theory of relativity transformed the theoretical physics and astronomy during the 20th century by superseding a 200-years-old theory of mechanics created by Isaac Newton. The ideas behind relativity might seem mysterious, as they introduced new concepts such as four-dimensional spacetime, relativity of simultaneity, time dilation, and length contraction. The theory of relativity, given by Albert Einstein, includes two theories: special relativity and general relativity. Albert Einstein published special theory of relativity and general theory of relativity in 1905 and 1915, respectively. Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of gravity. General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to the forces of nature. Einstein explained the situations in which Newtonian physics might fail to deal successfully with phenomena, and in doing so proposed revolutionary changes in human concepts of time, space and gravity. Over the last century, many experiments have confirmed the validity of both special relativity and general relativity. It includes the observation that light deflect from distant stars as the starlight passed by our sun, proving that gravity distort or curve space. Instead of being an invisible force that attracts objects to one another, gravity is a curving or warping of space. The more massive an object, the more it warps the space around it, as shown in the cover picture of this unit. The special theory of relativity became an important and necessary tool in the new fields of nuclear physics, atomic physics and quantum mechanics. Nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons etc., would be impossible without the knowledge that matter can be transformed into energy. So, the theory has an enormous impact on the modern world.

Inertial Reference Frame An inertial reference frame is a frame of reference in which Newton's law holds true: i.e., an object at rest remains at rest, and object in motion remains in motion with a constant velocity on a straight line, unless acted upon by an external force. A frame of reference that is at rest or moving with a uniform velocity along a straight line is called an inertial frame of reference. An inertial frame of reference does not accelerate. Any reference frame that moves with constant velocity relative to an inertial frame is itself inertial. The Earth can be considered an inertial reference frame for many experiments. The interior of a car moving along a road at constant velocity and the interior of a stationary house are examples of inertial reference frames. Non-inertial Reference Frame In a non-inertial frame of reference, objects experience acceleration even in the absence of applied forces because the reference frame itself is accelerating relative to an inertial frame. Newton's laws do not hold in a non-inertial frame of reference. \u2018A frame of reference that is accelerating is called a non-inertial frame of reference.

Both the individuals are in inertial frames of reference, where Newton\u2019s laws apply equally for both of them. Both persons will observe the ball falling in a vertical path. If the trains are windowless, the passengers will have no way of knowing whether their train is stationary or moving at constant velocity. 2) The Principle of the Constancy of the Speed of Light The speed of light in vacuum is always constant for all observers, regardless of the relative velocity between the source of light and the observer measuring it. No matter how fast an observer or the light source is moving, measured speed of light (c) always yields the same value i.e., \u00a2 = 299,792,458 ms\". This postulate has profound implications, particularly as it contradicts Newtonian mechanics. For instant, you were travelling at 0.5c in the same direction as the beam of light, Newtonian mechanics predicts that you would observe the speed of the light beam to be 0.5c. However, according to special relativity, you would still observe the speed of light to be at c. This leads to a range of fascinating effects. When a stationary person measures the speed of light emitted from a train at rest, the speed is simply c.

Mirror 13.3 CONSEQUENCES OF THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY There are other surprising consequences of the special theory of relativity. These consequences of the special theory of relativity are summarized in the following. Relativity of simultaneity Two events that are simultaneous for one observer, may not be simultaneous for another observer in relative motion. For example, consider a person is standing next to a train track and comparing observations of a lightning storm with a person inside a moving train. The train is moving at nearly the speed of light. Einstein imagined scenario when the train is positioned at a point on the track equally between two trees. If a bolt of lightning strikes both trees at the same time, the person standing beside the track would receive the strike as simultaneous. However, because the person inside the train is moving toward one lightning bolt and away from the other, the person on the moving train would see the bolt ahead of the train first, and the bolt behind the train later."

This phenomenon is known as mass variation, is another expression of mass-energy equivalence. It is represented mathematically as: (13.4) Where, m is the relativistic mass, m, is the rest mass of particle, c is the speed of light and v is the velocity of the particle relative to a stationary observer. This effect becomes noticeable only at relativistic speeds (speed close to the speed of light). As an object is accelerated closer to the speed of light, its mass increases. The more massive it becomes, the more energy is required to achieve the same acceleration, making further acceleration more and more difficult. The energy that is put into attempting acceleration is instead converted into mass. The total energy of an object is kinetic energy plus the energy embodied in its mass. To accelerate even the smallest object to the speed of light would require an infinite amount of energy. Therefore, material objects are restricted to speeds less than the speed of light. Example 13.1: If a 0.5 kg body is moving at a speed of equivalent to 90 % of the speed of light. What will be its mass in this situation? Given: v = 90 of c = 0.9\u00a2 Mo = 0.5 kg To Find: m=?

This pairing of electron and positron is an example of matter-antimatter annihilation. When an electron and a positron collide, they annihilate each other, converting their masses into energy in the form of gamma rays. This process is known as matter-antimatter annihilation. Proton-Antiproton: Proton: A proton is a subatomic particle found in the nucleus of an atom. It carries a positive electric charge of +1e and has a mass of approximately 1.67 x 107? kg. Antiproton: The antiproton is the antiparticle counterpart of the proton. It shares the same mass as a proton (approximately 1.67 x 10?\u201d kg) but carries a negative electric charge of -1e. Antiprotons can be produced artificially in high-energy particle accelerators and are used in scientific experiments to study the fundamental properties of matter. These examples highlight the principle of charge conservation in particle-antiparticle pairs, where the total charge remains conserved while exhibiting opposite signs. Additionally, the conservation of mass is also evident as the masses of particles and their corresponding antiparticles are identical. 14.2.1 Alpha Decays In alpha decay, atomic number of the parent nucleus reduces by 2 and the mass number reduces by 4 units.

These processes occur in atomic nuclei to achieve a more stable nuclear configuration. Here's how each process works: In beta-minus decay, a neutron (n) within the nucleus is transformed into a proton (p), an electron (beta-minus particle # ), and an antineutrino (ve). The antineutrino is a nearly massless, electrically neutral particle that carries away some of the energy released during the decay. The emitted beta-minus particle is an electron.

Both beta minus and beta plus decay processes are governed by the weak nuclear force, one of the fundamental forces in nature responsible for mediating certain types of particle interactions. These processes play a crucial role in the overall stability and transformation of atomic nuclei, allowing them to achieve more balanced configurations and release excess energy. 14.2.3 Energies for Alpha and Beta Decay Alpha and beta particles are products of radioactive decay processes, and they carry different amounts of energy due to their distinct properties and mechanisms of emission. Alpha particles have discrete energies in nuclear processes due to the specific nature of the quantum mechanical interactions within atomic nuclei. These energies are determined by the energy levels and quantum states of the particles within the nucleus, as well as the binding forces that hold the nucleus together. Inside a nucleus, protons and neutrons are arranged in energy levels or shells, similar to how electrons are arranged in energy levels around an atom\u2019s nucleus.

When an alpha particle is formed during radioactive decay, it involves the rearrangement of nucleons within the nucleus, which results in specific energy changes. Quantization of Energy Levels: Just as electrons in an atom can only exist only at certain discrete energy levels, nucleons within a nucleus also occupy quantized energy levels. When nucleons rearrange themselves to form an alpha particle, the energy change corresponds to the difference between the initial and final energy states. Binding Energies: The formation of an alpha particle involves the strong nuclear force, which binds nucleons together in the nucleus. As nucleons combine to form an alpha particle, changes occur in the binding energies of the particles involved. These changes result in the release of energy, which is carried away by the alpha particle. Conservation of Energy: The conservation of energy is a principle in all physical processes. The total energy of the system before and after the alpha particle emission must be conserved. This conservation leads to the emission of alpha particles with specific, well-defined energies. Consequently, the energies of alpha particles emitted in nuclear processes are quantized and discrete. These specific energy levels of alpha particles provide valuable information about the structure of atomic nuclei, the binding forces involved, and the dynamics of nuclear reactions. 261"

    "text": "PARTICLE PHYSICS Energy of beta particles: The continuous energies spectrum of beta particles in nuclear processes can be attributed to the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, along with the conservation of energy and momentum. Unlike alpha particles, which have discrete energies, the energies of beta particles are spread out over a range of values. This continuous energy spectrum arises from several factors: i) Quantum Uncertainty: In quantum mechanics, particles are described by wave functions that exhibit inherent uncertainty in certain properties, including energy. This uncertainty allows for a range of possible energies for a given particle. When a beta particle is emitted during a nuclear decay, its specific energy is not predetermined but subject to quantum uncertainty. ii) Neutrinos in Beta Decay: In beta decay processes, such as beta-minus (B-) and beta-plus (B+) decay, an additional particle is involved: the neutrino or antineutrino. These particles are extremely lightweight and have negligible mass, which means they carry away some of the energy released during the decay, This leads to a spread of energies in the emitted beta particles, as the neutrinos can ws varying, amounts of energy, leaving less for the beta particles. iii) Conservation Laws: While the total energy before and after beta decay must be conserved, there is flexibility in how that energy is distributed between the emitted beta particle and the accompanying neutrino. This flexibility results in a continuum of possible energy values for the beta particles. iv) Final State Interactions: In some cases, the emitted beta particles can interact with other particles or fields as they travel through matter. These interactions can affect the energy and momentum of the beta particles, contributing to the continuous energy spectrum observed in experiments. 14.3 MATTER AND ANTI-MATTER | Peta Bb each see aera ei Tip TF SSIS oe tk Ne"

Higgs particle has a mass of 124.97 GeV/c\u2019, making it 130 times more massive than a proton.

For force we have two main theories i.e., quantum field theory and the string theory. Quantum Field Theory (QFT): Quantum field theory is a set of physical principles that combine the elements of quantum mechanics with the theory of relativity to explain the behavior of sub atomic particles and their interactions due to a variety of force fields. Three different quantum field theories address three of the four fundamental forces in nature. Matter interacts through these forces. Electromagnetism explains how atoms hold together, strong nuclear force explains the stability of nucleus and the weak nuclear force explains why some atoms undergo radioactive decay. QFT describes the particles as excited states of quantum fields, which are more fundamental than particles themselves. Interaction between the particles is basically an interaction between the fields. Each interaction can be represented by a Feynman diagram. Similarly, according to QFT, mass is not the strength of attraction of two bodies or the quantity of matter; rather, it is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its speed and position. In precise, at the smallest level, everything is made up of some entities or fluid-like substance call quantum field. This field sometimes behaves like particles, sometimes like waves, and they'can even interact with each other. - 274"

Just like at very high energies, electrons are not confined to their atoms i.e., electrons and ions are found in plasma state. Similarly, at very high energies, the baryonic matter gets the same plasma state called quark- gluon plasma, the high temperature soup that made up the universe just after the Big Bang. In this state of baryonic matter, quarks and gluons are no longer confined to each other by the strong force. Instead, they become free from their mutual attraction. ; Particle accelerators are not only used for scientific research but they can also be used in various other field of daily life, including medical field. Some uses of particle accelerators are listed below: . , e Linear accelerators are used to produce medical isotopes, and create beams of radiations for cancer treatment.
